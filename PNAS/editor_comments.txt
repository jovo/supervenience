This contribution attempts to address a question that humanity has wrestled with for millennia: "what is the relationship between minds and brains?"  Previous formulations of this question lay squarely within the realm of philosophy.  We propose a relaxed version of this question, called epsilon-supervenience, using modern statistical theory, that is emendable to experimental investigation. It is our belief that this work will be of general interest to the scientific community at large.  Because the work pulls from fields as disparate as philosophy, statistics, and neuroscience, other "general" scientific journals are not sufficiently general to encapsulate all aspects of this manuscript.  Therefore, PNAS is amongst the only (and certainly the best) forum for publication of this work.  Thank you for considering this manuscript.
