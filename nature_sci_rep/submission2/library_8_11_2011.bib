abstract = {In this paper we present a novel method for multi-fiber reconstruction given a diffusion-weighted MRI dataset. There are several existing methods that employ various spherical deconvolution kernels for achieving this task. However the kernels in all of the existing methods rely on certain assumptions regarding the properties of the underlying fibers, which introduce inaccuracies and unnatural limitations in them. Our model is a non trivial generalization of the spherical deconvolution model, which unlike the existing methods does not make use of a fix-shaped kernel. Instead, the shape of the kernel is estimated simultaneously with the rest of the unknown parameters by employing a general adaptive model that can theoretically approximate any spherical deconvolution kernel. The performance of our model is demonstrated using simulated and real diffusion-weighed MR datasets and compared quantitatively with several existing techniques in literature. The results obtained indicate that our model has superior performance that is close to the theoretic limit of the best possible achievable result.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal activity patterns in three-dimensionally organized
cellular networks are fundamental to the function of the nervous
system. Despite advances in functional imaging of cell populations,
a method to resolve local network activity in three dimensions has
been lacking. Here we introduce a three-dimensional (3D) line-scan
technology for two-photon microscopy that permits fast fluorescence
measurements from several hundred cells distributed in 3D space.
We combined sinusoidal vibration of the microscope objective at 10
Hz with 'smart' movements of galvanometric x-y scanners to repeatedly
scan the laser focus along a closed 3D trajectory. More than 90\%
of cell somata were sampled by the scan line within volumes of 250
microm side length. Using bulk-loading of calcium indicator, we applied
this method to reveal spatiotemporal activity patterns in neuronal
and astrocytic networks in the rat neocortex in vivo. Two-photon
population imaging using 3D scanning opens the field for comprehensive
studies of local network dynamics in intact tissue.},

abstract = {Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is associated with autoantibodies against
desmoglein (Dsg) 3 inducing epidermal loss of adhesion. The major
pathogenic epitopes of Dsg3 are presumably dependent of their conformation.
The aim of this study was to characterize the IgG reactivity of sera
from a cohort of clinically well-characterized PV patients against
presumably non-conformational subdomains of the Dsg3 ectodomain including
recently described NH2-terminal immunodominant epitopes. By ELISA,
IgG reactivity against distinct subdomains of Dsg3 was related to
disease activity and the clinical phenotype of PV patients. Our findings
suggest that (i) autoantibody from PV sera react with non-conformational
epitopes of Dsg3; (ii) IgG reactivity against the NH2-terminus and
the extracellular domains (EC) 2-4 of Dsg3 was associated with active
PV, while IgG titres were not strictly correlated with disease activity
and (iii) IgG reactivity against the EC1-4 was associated with mucosal
dominant PV and was decreased in cutaneous dominant PV. The findings
may help to define more refined serological disease markers of PV.},

abstract = {The development of genetically encoded fluorescent voltage probes is essential to image electrical activity from neuronal populations. Previous green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based probes have had limited success in recording electrical activity of neurons because of their low sensitivity and poor temporal resolution. Here we describe a hybrid approach that combines a genetically encoded fluorescent probe (membrane-anchored enhanced GFP) with dipicrylamine, a synthetic voltage-sensing molecule that partitions into the plasma membrane. The movement of the synthetic voltage sensor is translated via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) into a large fluorescence signal (up to 34\% change per 100 mV) with a fast response and recovery time (0.5 ms). Using this two-component approach, we were able to optically record action potentials from neuronal cell lines and trains of action potentials from primary cultured neurons. This hybrid approach may form the basis for a new generation of protein-based voltage probes.},

abstract = {Plenty of methods have been proposed in order to discover latent variables (features) in data sets. Such approaches include the principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), factor analysis (FA), etc., to mention only a few. A recently investigated approach to decompose a data set with a given dimensionality into a lower dimensional space is the so-called nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Its only requirement is that both decomposition factors are nonnegative. To approximate the original data, the minimization of the NMF objective function is performed in the Euclidean space, where the difference between the original data and the factors can be minimized by employing L(2)-norm. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the NMF algorithm by translating the objective function into a Hilbert space (also called feature space) under nonnegativity constraints. With the help of kernel functions, we developed an approach that allows high-order dependencies between the basis images while keeping the nonnegativity constraints on both basis images and coefficients. Two practical applications, namely, facial expression and face recognition, show the potential of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Atlas-based segmentation techniques are often employed to encode anatomical information for the delineation of multiple structures in magnetic resonance images of the brain. One of the primary challenges of these approaches is to efficiently model qualitative and quantitative anatomical knowledge without introducing a strong bias toward certain anatomical preferences when segmenting new images. This paper explores the use of topological information as a prior and proposes a segmentation framework based on both topological and statistical atlases of brain anatomy. Topology can be used to describe continuity of structures, as well as the relationships between structures, and is often a critical component in cortical surface reconstruction and deformation-based morphometry. Our method guarantees strict topological equivalence between the segmented image and the atlas, and relies only weakly on a statistical atlas of shape. Tissue classification and fast marching methods are used to provide a powerful and flexible framework to handle multiple image contrasts, high levels of noise, gain field inhomogeneities, and variable anatomies. The segmentation algorithm has been validated on simulated and real brain image data and made freely available to researchers. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and the limited influence of the statistical atlas.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, a large family of algorithms - supervised or unsupervised; stemming from statistics or geometry theory - has been designed to provide different solutions to the problem of dimensionality reduction. Despite the different motivations of these algorithms, we present in this paper a general formulation known as graph embedding to unify them within a common framework. In graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. Furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called Marginal Fisher Analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability. We show that MFA effectively overcomes the limitations of the traditional Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm due to data distribution assumptions and available projection directions. Real face recognition experiments show the superiority of our proposed MFA in comparison to LDA, also for corresponding kernel and tensor extensions.},

providing a quantitative understanding of these kinetics, we measured
the buildup and decay of calcium ions in nerve terminals at the crayfish
neuromuscular junction under a variety of intracellular buffer conditions

was characterized by analysis of calcium levels reached during long
stimulus trains as a function of action potential frequency. The
extrusion was linearly dependent on the free calcium ion concentration.
Using this result, we developed a mathematical model and computer
simulation of the residual calcium kinetics. The model demonstrates
the experimentally observed dependence of decay rate on exogenous
calcium buffer concentration, and can be explicitly solved to provide
an expression for the limiting exponential time course of calcium
decay following trains in terms of calcium buffer and extrusion characteristics.
Methods to determine the calcium influx per action potential, characteristics
of endogenous buffer, and the rate of calcium extrusion are suggested
by our analysis and demonstrated experimentally.},

abstract = {Measuring agreement between a statistical model and a spike train data series, that is, evaluating goodness of fit, is crucial for establishing the model's validity prior to using it to make inferences about a particular neural system. Assessing goodness-of-fit is a challenging problem for point process neural spike train models, especially for histogram-based models such as perstimulus time histograms (PSTH) and rate functions estimated by spike train smoothing. The time-rescaling theorem is a well-known result in probability theory, which states that any point process with an integrable conditional intensity function may be transformed into a Poisson process with unit rate. We describe how the theorem may be used to develop goodness-of-fit tests for both parametric and histogram-based point process models of neural spike trains. We apply these tests in two examples: a comparison of PSTH, inhomogeneous Poisson, and inhomogeneous Markov interval models of neural spike trains from the supplementary eye field of a macque monkey and a comparison of temporal and spatial smoothers, inhomogeneous Poisson, inhomogeneous gamma, and inhomogeneous inverse gaussian models of rat hippocampal place cell spiking activity. To help make the logic behind the time-rescaling theorem more accessible to researchers in neuroscience, we present a proof using only elementary probability theory arguments. We also show how the theorem may be used to simulate a general point process model of a spike train. Our paradigm makes it possible to compare parametric and histogram-based neural spike train models directly. These results suggest that the time-rescaling theorem can be a valuable tool for neural spike train data analysis.},

abstract = {Contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation and contextual modulation of primary visual cortex (V1) neuron responses to stimulation of their receptive field reveal long-distance integration of visual signals within V1, well beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) of single neurons. To identify the cortical circuits mediating these long-distance computations, we have used a combination of anatomical and physiological recording methods to determine the spatial scale and retinotopic logic of intra-areal V1 horizontal connections and inter-areal feedback connections to V1. We have then compared the spatial scales of these connectional systems to the spatial dimensions of the cRF, spatial summation field (SF), and modulatory surround field of macaque V1 neurons. We find that monosynaptic horizontal connections within area V1 are of an appropriate spatial scale to mediate interactions within the SF of V1 neurons and to underlie contrast-dependent changes in SF size. Contrary to common beliefs, these connections cannot fully account for the dimensions of the surround field. The spatial scale of feedback circuits from extrastriate cortex to V1 is, instead, commensurate with the full spatial range of center-surround interactions. Thus these connections could represent an anatomical substrate for contextual modulation and global-to-local integration of visual signals. Feedback projections connect corresponding and equal-sized regions of the visual field in striate and extrastriate cortices and cover anisotropic parts of visual space, unlike V1 horizontal connections that are isotropic in the macaque.

abstract = {A path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics is ivestigated which
is closely related to that of Feynman. It differs from Feynman's
formulation in that it involves the Hamiltnoian function of the canonically
conjugate coordinates and momenta. The classical limit yields the
variational principle: delta f(p-N)dt=0. A path integral formula
is also obtained for the energy eigenstate projection operator associated
with the time-independent Schrodinger equation. The classical limit
of the projection operator formula yields a modified form of the
well-known variational principle for the phase-space orbit of given
energy. Relativistically covariant Hamiltonian variational principles
are analyzed and lead naturally to a relativistic scalar wave equation
which involves a proper time variable which is canonically conjugate
to the mass in the same manner as the ordinary time variable is conjugate
to the energy in nonrelativistic quantum theory.},

We found a marked difference in the effect of transpositions in the two languages. In English, transpositions had little effect on performance, whereas in Hebrew, performance deteriorated dramatically for words with transposed letters. The differential effects of transposition are accounted for by the difference in lexical organization in Hebrew and in English, suggesting that models of reading in alphabetic orthographies may be language specific.},

abstract = {Initial analysis of interaural temporal disparities (ITDs), a cue for sound localization, occurs in the superior olivary complex. The medial superior olive (MSO) receives excitatory input from the left and right cochlear nuclei. Its neurons are believed to be coincidence detectors, discharging when input arrives simultaneously from the two sides. Many current psychophysical models assume a strict version of coincidence, in which neurons of the MSO cross correlate their left and right inputs. However, there have been few tests of this assumption. Here we examine data derived from two earlier studies of the MSO and compare the responses to the output of a computational model. We find that the MSO is not an ideal cross correlator. Ideal cross correlation implies a strict relationship between the precision of phase-locking of the inputs and the range of ITDs to which a neuron responds. This relationship does not appear to be met. Instead, the modeling implies that a neuron responds over a wider range of ITDs than expected from the inferred precision of phase-locking of the inputs. The responses are more consistent with a scheme in which the neuron can also be activated by the input from one side alone. Such activation degrades the tuning of neurons in the MSO to ITDs.},

In this work, we describe femtosecond diode pumped Cr:LiCAF laser technology as a low cost alternative to femtosecond Ti:Sapphire lasers for MPM. Using single mode pump diodes which cost only \$150 each, a diode pumped Cr:LiCAF laser generates approximately 70-fs duration, 1.8-nJ pulses at approximately 800 nm wavelengths, with a repetition rate of 100 MHz and average output power of 180 mW. Representative examples of MPM imaging in neuroscience, immunology, endocrinology and cancer research using Cr:LiCAF laser technology are presented. These studies demonstrate the potential of this laser source for use in a broad range of MPM applications.},

Dendrites are, however, frequently oriented perpendicular to tissue surfaces, impeding in vivo imaging approaches. Here we introduce novel laser-scanning modes for two-photon microscopy that enable in vivo imaging of spatiotemporal activity patterns in dendrites. First, we developed a method to image planes arbitrarily oriented in 3D, which proved particularly beneficial for calcium imaging of parallel fibers and Purkinje cell dendrites in rat cerebellar cortex. Second, we applied free linescans -- either through multiple dendrites or along a single vertically oriented dendrite -- to reveal fast dendritic calcium dynamics in neocortical pyramidal neurons. Finally, we invented a ribbon-type 3D scanning method for imaging user-defined convoluted planes enabling simultaneous measurements of calcium signals along multiple apical dendrites. These novel scanning modes will facilitate optical probing of dendritic function in vivo.},

The EAE consisted of tone pips of 32 different frequencies (5-20 kHz), presented in random order at an average rate of 96 Hz. The EAE caused a strong reduction of the representation of EAE frequencies and an over-representation of frequencies neighboring those of the EAE. This is in sharp contrast with earlier developmental studies showing an enlargement of the cortical representation of EAEs consisting of a narrow frequency band. We observed fewer than normal appropriately tuned short-latency responses to EAE frequencies, together with more common long-latency responses tuned to EAE-neighboring frequencies.},

abstract = {1. Single units and evoked potentials were recorded in dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) in response to electrical stimulation of the somatosensory dorsal column and spinal trigeminal nuclei (together called MSN for medullary somatosensory nuclei) and for tactile somatosensory stimuli. Recordings were from paralyzed decerebrate cats. 2. DCN principal cells (type IV units) were strongly inhibited by electrical stimulation (single 50-microA bipolar pulse) in MSN or by somatosensory stimulation. Units recorded in the fusiform cell and deep layers of DCN were inhibited, suggesting that the inhibition affects both types of principal cells (i.e., both fusiform and giant cells). 3. Interneurons (type II units) that inhibit principal cells were only weakly inhibited by electrical stimulation and were never excited, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect on principal cells does not pass through the type II circuit. In the vicinity of the DCN/PVCN (posteroventral cochlear nucleus) boundary, units were encountered that were excited by electrical stimulation in MSN; some of these neurons responded to sound, and some did not. Their response properties are consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep-layer inhibitory interneurons conveying somatosensory information to the DCN. 4. Analysis of the evoked potentials produced by electrical stimulation in MSN suggests that the somatosensory inputs activate the granule cell system of the DCN molecular layer. A model based on previous work by Klee and Rall was used to show that the distribution of evoked potentials in DCN can be explained as resulting from radial currents produced in the DCN molecular and fusiform-cell layers by synchronous activation of granule cells inputs to fusiform and cartwheel cells. Current-source density analysis of the evoked potentials is consistent with this model. Thus molecular layer interneurons (cartwheel and stellate cells) are a second possible source of inhibition to principal cells. 5. With lower stimulus levels (20 microA) and pulse-pair stimuli (50- to 100-ms interstimulus interval), three components of the inhibitory response can be recognized in both fusiform cell layer and deep layer type IV units: a short-latency inhibition that begins before the start of the evoked potential; a longer-latency inhibition whose timing corresponds to the evoked potential; and an excitatory component that occurs on the rising phase of the evoked potential. The excitatory component is usually overwhelmed by the inhibitory components and could be derived from granule cell inputs; the long-latency inhibitory component could be derived from cartwheel cells or the hypothesized deep-layer inhibitory interneurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

model for learning at the single-cell level. Yet, despite its popularity

in experimental and theoretical neuroscience, the influence of dendritic

mechanisms in the induction of STDP has been largely overlooked.

Several recent studies have investigated how active dendritic properties

and synapse location within the dendritic tree influence STDP. These

studies suggest the existence of learning rules that depend on firing

to STDP. Here, we propose a new look at STDP that is focused on processing

abstract = {In the visual cortex of higher mammals, neurons are arranged across
the cortical surface in an orderly map of preferred stimulus orientations.
This map contains 'orientation pinwheels', structures that are arranged
like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously
around a centre. Conventional optical imaging first demonstrated
these pinwheels, but the technique lacked the spatial resolution
to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near
pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated
sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres, but it remained
unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion.
Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo to determine the microstructure
of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution.
We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective
to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very
centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the
cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single
cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits
underlying orientation selectivity.},

abstract = {The postsynaptic density (PSD) signaling machinery contains proteins with diverse functions. Brain region-specific variations in PSD components mediate distinct physiological responses to synaptic activation. We have developed mass spectrometry-based methods to comprehensively compare both relative protein expression and phosphorylation status from proteins present in biochemical preparations of postsynaptic density. Using these methods, we determined the relative expression of 2159 proteins and 1564 phosphorylation sites in PSD preparations from murine cortex, midbrain, cerebellum, and hippocampus. These experiments were conducted twice using independent biological replicates, which allowed us to assess the experimental and biological variability in this system. Concerning protein expression, cluster analysis revealed that known functionally associated proteins display coordinated synaptic expression. Therefore, proteins identified as co-clustering with known protein complexes are prime candidates for assignment as previously unrecognized components. Concerning degree of phosphorylation, we observed more extensive phosphorylation sites on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors than alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, consistent with the central role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in processing synaptic transmission patterns. Average kinase and phosphatase levels were highest in the hippocampus, correlating with a higher overall phosphopeptide abundance present in this brain region. These findings suggest that the hippocampus utilizes reversible protein phosphorylation to a greater extent than other brain regions when modifying synaptic strength.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron accumulation as seen in genetic haemochromatosis
is a major cause of hepatic fibrogenesis. A link between chronic
liver disease and Dupuytren's disease (DD) is well established, especially
in alcoholics. AIM: The aim of the present study was to test the
hypothesis that iron accumulation might cause fibrosis of the palmar
aponeurosis leading to DD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined iron
metabolism, mutations of the HFE gene, serum cholesterol, alcohol
consumption, presence of chronic liver disease, diabetes and history
of severe manual work in a group of 90 patients who had undergone
surgery for a severe form of DD. The tissue removed during surgery
was histologically examined to confirm the diagnosis of DD. For a
control group, we used 33 healthy subjects with similar profiles.
RESULTS: The DD group consisted of 82 men and 8 women. Chronic liver
disease was found in 27\% of DD patients, compared with 6.1\% of
control subjects (P = 0.013). A history of hand traumatization was
present in 33\% of DD patients vs. 15\% of control subjects (P =
0.048). Excessive alcohol consumption was present in 35.5\% of DD
patients compared with 15.1\% of controls (P = 0.029). None of the
other tested parameters, including the prevalence of HFE gene mutations,
showed a significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS:
Iron accumulation does not play a major role in the pathogenesis
of DD. However, sex, age, manual labour and alcohol consumption are
risk factors for progression of DD. We observed a high incidence
of chronic liver disease in patients with DD.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) structural information on many length scales is of central importance in biological research. Excellent methods exist to obtain structures of molecules at atomic, organelles at electron microscopic, and tissue at light-microscopic resolution. A gap exists, however, when 3D tissue structure needs to be reconstructed over hundreds of micrometers with a resolution sufficient to follow the thinnest cellular processes and to identify small organelles such as synaptic vesicles. Such 3D data are, however, essential to understand cellular networks that, particularly in the nervous system, need to be completely reconstructed throughout a substantial spatial volume. Here we demonstrate that datasets meeting these requirements can be obtained by automated block-face imaging combined with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Backscattering contrast is used to visualize the heavy-metal staining of tissue prepared using techniques that are routine for transmission electron microscopy. Low-vacuum (20-60 Pa H(2)O) conditions prevent charging of the uncoated block face. The resolution is sufficient to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify synapses. Stacks of several hundred sections, 50-70 nm thick, have been obtained at a lateral position jitter of typically under 10 nm. This opens the possibility of automatically obtaining the electron-microscope-level 3D datasets needed to completely reconstruct the connectivity of neuronal circuits.},

abstract = {Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) has been shown to be critical for the
formation of dentin and bone. However, the precise pathway by which
DMP1 participates in dentinogenesis and osteogenesis remains to be
clarified. DMP1 is present in the extracellular matrix of dentin
and bone as processed NH(2)- and COOH-terminal fragments. The NH(2)-terminal
fragment occurs as a proteoglycan, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment
is highly phosphorylated. The differences in biochemical properties
suggest that these fragments may have different tissue and cell distribution
in association with distinct functions. In this study, we analyzed
the distribution of the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal fragments of DMP1
in tooth, bone, osteocytes as well as MC3T3-E1 and HEK-293 cells.
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using antibodies specific
to the NH(2)- or COOH-terminal region of DMP1. Clear differences
in the distribution of these fragments were observed. In the teeth
and bone, the NH(2)-terminal fragment was primarily located in the
nonmineralized predentin and cartilage of the growth plate, while
the COOH-terminal fragment accumulated in the mineralized zones.
In osteocytes, the NH(2)-terminal fragment appeared more abundant
along cell membrane and processes of osteocytes, while the COOH-terminal
fragment was often found in the nuclei. This pattern of distribution
in cellular compartments was further confirmed by analyses on MC3T3-E1
and HEK-293 cells transfected with a construct containing DMP1 cDNA.
In these cell lines, the COOH-terminal fragment accumulated in cell
nuclei, while the NH(2)-terminal fragment was in the cytosol. The
different distribution of DMP1 fragments indicates that these DMP1
variants must perform distinct functions.},

A technique that would allow recording of temporal and spatial dynamics of electrical activity in neuronal processes with adequate resolution would facilitate further research. Here, we report on the application of optical recording of membrane potential transients at many sites on neuronal processes of vertebrate neurons in brain slices using intracellular voltage-sensitive dyes. We obtained evidence that 1) loading the neurons with voltage-sensitive dye using patch electrodes is possible without contamination of the extracellular environment; 2) brain slices do not show any autofluorescence at the excitation/emission wavelengths used; 3) pharmacological effects of the dye were completely reversible; 4) the level of photodynamic damage already allows meaningful measurements and could be reduced further; 5) the sensitivity of the dye was comparable to that reported for invertebrate neurons; 6) the dye spread approximately 500 micron into distal processes within 2 h incubation period. This distance should increase with longer incubation; 7) the optically recorded action potential signals from basolateral dendrites (that are difficult or impossible to approach by patch electrodes) and apical dendrites show that both direct soma stimulation and synaptic stimulation triggered action potentials that originated near the soma. The spikes backpropagated into both basolateral dendrites and apical processes; the propagation was somewhat faster in the apical dendrites.},

@article{Warfield2004,
abstract = {Characterizing the performance of image segmentation approaches has been a persistent challenge. Performance analysis is important since segmentation algorithms often have limited accuracy and precision. Interactive drawing of the desired segmentation by human raters has often been the only acceptable approach, and yet suffers from intra-rater and inter-rater variability. Automated algorithms have been sought in order to remove the variability introduced by raters, but such algorithms must be assessed to ensure they are suitable for the task. The performance of raters (human or algorithmic) generating segmentations of medical images has been difficult to quantify because of the difficulty of obtaining or estimating a known true segmentation for clinical data. Although physical and digital phantoms can be constructed for which ground truth is known or readily estimated, such phantoms do not fully reflect clinical images due to the difficulty of constructing phantoms which reproduce the full range of imaging characteristics and normal and pathological anatomical variability observed in clinical data. Comparison to a collection of segmentations by raters is an attractive alternative since it can be carried out directly on the relevant clinical imaging data. However, the most appropriate measure or set of measures with which to compare such segmentations has not been clarified and several measures are used in practice. We present here an expectation-maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE). The algorithm considers a collection of segmentations and computes a probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation and a measure of the performance level represented by each segmentation. The source of each segmentation in the collection may be an appropriately trained human rater or raters, or may be an automated segmentation algorithm. The probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation is formed by estimating an optimal combination of the segmentations, weighting each segmentation depending upon the estimated performance level, and incorporating a prior model for the spatial distribution of structures being segmented as well as spatial homogeneity constraints. STAPLE is straightforward to apply to clinical imaging data, it readily enables assessment of the performance of an automated image segmentation algorithm, and enables direct comparison of human rater and algorithm performance.},

abstract = {In the dorsal cochlear nucleus, long-term synaptic plasticity can be induced at the parallel fiber inputs that synapse onto both fusiform principal neurons and cartwheel feedforward inhibitory interneurons. Here we report that in mouse fusiform cells, spikes evoked 5 ms after parallel-fiber excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) led to long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas spikes evoked 5 ms before EPSPs led to long-term depression (LTD) of the synapse. The EPSP-spike protocol led to LTD in cartwheel cells, but no synaptic changes resulted from the reverse sequence (spike-EPSP). Plasticity in fusiform and cartwheel cells therefore followed Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules, respectively. Similarly, spikes generated by summing EPSPs from different groups of parallel fibers produced LTP in fusiform cells, and LTD in cartwheel cells. LTD could also be induced in glutamatergic inputs of cartwheel cells by pairing parallel-fiber EPSPs with depolarizing glycinergic PSPs from neighboring cartwheel cells. Thus, synaptic learning rules vary with the postsynaptic cell, and may require the interaction of different transmitter systems.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted imaging can potentially be used to infer the connectivity of the human brain in vivo using fibre-tracking techniques, and is therefore of great interest to neuroscientists and clinicians. A key requirement for fibre tracking is the accurate estimation of white matter fibre orientations within each imaging voxel. The diffusion tensor model, which is widely used for this purpose, has been shown to be inadequate in crossing fibre regions. A number of approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue, based on high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) data. In this study, an experimental model of crossing fibres, consisting of water-filled plastic capillaries, is used to thoroughly assess three such techniques: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), super-resolved CSD (super-CSD) and Q-ball imaging (QBI). HARDI data were acquired over a range of crossing angles and b-values, from which fibre orientations were computed using each technique. All techniques were capable of resolving the two fibre populations down to a crossing angle of 45 degrees , and down to 30 degrees for super-CSD. A bias was observed in the fibre orientations estimated by QBI for crossing angles other than 90 degrees, consistent with previous simulation results. Finally, for a 45 degrees crossing, the minimum b-value required to resolve the fibre orientations was 4000 s/mm(2) for QBI, 2000 s/mm(2) for CSD, and 1000 s/mm(2) for super-CSD. The quality of estimation of fibre orientations may profoundly affect fibre tracking attempts, and the results presented provide important additional information regarding performance characteristics of well-known methods.},

abstract = {While recent studies of synaptic stability in adult cerebral cortex have focused on dendrites, how much axons change is unknown. We have used advances in axon labeling by viruses and in vivo two-photon microscopy to investigate axon branching and bouton dynamics in primary visual cortex (V1) of adult Macaque monkeys. A nonreplicative adeno-associated virus bearing the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (AAV.EGFP) provided persistent labeling of axons, and a custom-designed two-photon microscope enabled repeated imaging of the intact brain over several weeks. We found that large-scale branching patterns were stable but that a subset of small branches associated with terminaux boutons, as well as a subset of en passant boutons, appeared and disappeared every week. Bouton losses and gains were both approximately 7\% of the total population per week, with no net change in the overall density. These results suggest ongoing processes of synaptogenesis and elimination in adult V1.},

abstract = {Retrograde axonal transport of nerve growth factor (NGF) signals is

critical for the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of peripheral

sympathetic and sensory neurons and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.

However, the mechanisms by which the NGF signal is propagated from

the axon terminal to the cell body are yet to be fully elucidated.

To gain insight into the mechanisms, we used quantum dot-labeled

NGF (QD-NGF) to track the movement of NGF in real time in compartmentalized

culture of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Our studies showed

that active transport of NGF within the axons was characterized by

rapid, unidirectional movements interrupted by frequent pauses. Almost

all movements were retrograde, but short-distance anterograde movements

were occasionally observed. Surprisingly, quantitative analysis at

the single molecule level demonstrated that the majority of NGF-containing

endosomes contained only a single NGF dimer. Electron microscopic

analysis of axonal vesicles carrying QD-NGF confirmed this finding.

The majority of QD-NGF was found to localize in vesicles 50-150 nm

in diameter with a single lumen and no visible intralumenal membranous

components. Our findings point to the possibility that a single NGF

dimer is sufficient to sustain signaling during retrograde axonal

transport to the cell body.},

We found that static estimates of the spectral and temporal contrasts of the calls were not effective features for discriminating among the call classes. A hidden Markov model (HMM), however, was more effective at discriminating among the call classes, reaching a performance of almost 75\% correct. Finally, we found that the responses of prefrontal auditory neurons could be predicted more effectively as linear functions of the probabilistic output of the HMM than as linear functions of the spectral features of the calls. This provides evidence that, for call recognition, the macaque auditory system likely performs dynamic processing of vocalizations, and that prefrontal auditory neurons carry a signal related to the output of this processing.},

is attractive in an austere environment, its effectiveness has not
been tested. We sought to compare the effectiveness of potable water
irrigation in reducing bacterial number with that of normal saline
irrigation. METHODS: We used an established caprine model involving
the creation of a reproducible complex musculoskeletal wound followed
by inoculation with luminescent bacteria that allowed for quantitative
analysis with a photon-counting camera system. Six hours after injury
and inoculation, wound irrigations were performed using pulsatile
lavage. Fourteen goats were randomized into two treatment groups:
irrigation with 9 L potable water versus irrigation with 9 L normal
saline. Images obtained after irrigation were compared with baseline
images to determine the reduction in bacterial luminescence resulting
from treatment. RESULTS: The irrigation in both groups reduced the
bacterial counts by 71\% from the preirrigation levels. CONCLUSION:
Potable water reduced the bacterial load as effectively as normal
saline in our model.},

abstract = {Spine \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} triggers the induction of synaptic plasticity and

other adaptive neuronal responses. The amplitude and time course

of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} signals specify the activation of the signaling pathways

that trigger different forms of plasticity such as long-term potentiation

and depression. The shapes of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} signals are determined

by the dynamics of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} sources, \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} buffers, and

\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} extrusion mechanisms. Here we show in rat CA1 pyramidal

neurons that plasma membrane \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} pumps (PMCAs) and Na+/\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}

exchangers are the major \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} extrusion pathways in spines

and small dendrites. Surprisingly, we found that \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} extrusion

via PMCA and Na+/\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} exchangers slows in an activity-dependent

manner, mediated by intracellular Na+ and \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} accumulations.

This activity-dependent depression of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} extrusion is, in

part, attributable to \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}-dependent inactivation of PMCAs.

\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} extrusion recovers from depression with a time constant

of 0.5 s. Depression of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} extrusion provides a positive

feedback loop, converting small differences in stimuli into large

differences in \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} concentration. Depression of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}

extrusion produces \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} concentration dynamics that depend

on the history of neuronal activity and therefore likely modulates

the induction of synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Many areas of biomedical research depend on the analysis of uncommon variations in individual genes or transcripts. Here we describe a method that can quantify such variation at a scale and ease heretofore unattainable. Each DNA molecule in a collection of such molecules is converted into a single magnetic particle to which thousands of copies of DNA identical in sequence to the original are bound. This population of beads then corresponds to a one-to-one representation of the starting DNA molecules. Variation within the original population of DNA molecules can then be simply assessed by counting fluorescently labeled particles via flow cytometry. This approach is called BEAMing on the basis of four of its principal components (beads, emulsion, amplification, and magnetics). Millions of individual DNA molecules can be assessed in this fashion with standard laboratory equipment. Moreover, specific variants can be isolated by flow sorting and used for further experimentation. BEAMing can be used for the identification and quantification of rare mutations as well as to study variations in gene sequences or transcripts in specific populations or tissues.},

preferences dominate. Here we show that strategic incentives are
the key to answering this question. A minority of self-regarding

aggregate outcome if their behavior generates incentives for a majority
of self-regarding people to behave cooperatively. Similarly, in strategic
games, aggregate outcomes can be either far from or close to Nash
equilibrium if players with high degrees of strategic thinking mimic
or erase the effects of others who do very little strategic thinking.

abstract = {Dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) principal cells receive, in addition to their well known auditory inputs, various nonauditory inputs via a cerebellar-like granule cell circuit located in the superficial layers of the DCN. Activation of this circuit (granule cell axons make excitatory synapses on the principal cells but also contact inhibitory interneurons that project to the principal cells) produces strong inhibition of the principal cells. Here we investigate the role of cartwheel cells, homologs of cerebellar Purkinje cells, in producing this inhibition. The responses of type IV units (one type of principal cells) and of cartwheel cells were recorded to ortho- and antidromic activation of the granule cells (i. e., by stimulation of their inputs from the somatosensory cuneate and spinal trigeminal nuclei and by direct stimulation of their parallel fiber axons). Cartwheel cells were identified on the basis of recording depth and complex action potential shape. A four-pulse facilitation paradigm (four pulses at 50 msec intervals) was used; this stimulus allows separation of the apparently simple inhibitory somatosensory response of type IV units into a three-component (inhibition-excitation-inhibition) response. As expected, cartwheel cells are excited by granule cell activation; the latencies and four-pulse amplitudes of these responses correspond to the properties of the second, long-latency inhibitory component of type IV responses. The source of the first, short-latency inhibitory response is still unknown. Nevertheless, these results show that cartwheel cells convey inhibitory polysensory information to DCN principal cells.},

abstract = {We developed a quantitative description of the circuits formed in cat area 17 by estimating the "weight" of the projections between different neuronal types. To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few "strong" but many "weak" excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that synaptic modifications underlie learning and memory. However, few studies have examined what can be deduced about the learning process from the distribution of synaptic weights. We analyze the perceptron, a prototypical feedforward neural network, and obtain the optimal synaptic weight distribution for a perceptron with excitatory synapses. It contains more than 50\% silent synapses, and this fraction increases with storage reliability: silent synapses are therefore a necessary byproduct of optimizing learning and reliability. Exploiting the classical analogy between the perceptron and the cerebellar Purkinje cell, we fitted the optimal weight distribution to that measured for granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses. The two distributions agreed well, suggesting that the Purkinje cell can learn up to 5 kilobytes of information, in the form of 40,000 input-output associations.},

@article{Desikan2006,
abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

abstract = {Pavlovian predictions of future aversive outcomes lead to behavioral inhibition, suppression, and withdrawal. There is considerable evidence for the involvement of serotonin in both the learning of these predictions and the inhibitory consequences that ensue, although less for a causal relationship between the two. In the context of a highly simplified model of chains of affectively charged thoughts, we interpret the combined effects of serotonin in terms of pruning a tree of possible decisions, (i.e., eliminating those choices that have low or negative expected outcomes). We show how a drop in behavioral inhibition, putatively resulting from an experimentally or psychiatrically influenced drop in serotonin, could result in unexpectedly large negative prediction errors and a significant aversive shift in reinforcement statistics. We suggest an interpretation of this finding that helps dissolve the apparent contradiction between the fact that inhibition of serotonin reuptake is the first-line treatment of depression, although serotonin itself is most strongly linked with aversive rather than appetitive outcomes and predictions.},

abstract = {To visualize \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}-dependent protein-protein interactions in

living cells by fluorescence readouts, we used a circularly permuted

green fluorescent protein (cpGFP), in which the amino and carboxyl

portions had been interchanged and reconnected by a short spacer

between the original termini. The cpGFP was fused to calmodulin and

its target peptide, M13. The chimeric protein, which we have named

"pericam," was fluorescent and its spectral properties changed reversibly

with the amount of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}, probably because of the interaction

between calmodulin and M13 leading to an alteration of the environment

surrounding the chromophore. Three types of pericam were obtained

by mutating several amino acids adjacent to the chromophore. Of these,

"flash-pericam" became brighter with \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}, whereas "inverse-pericam"

dimmed. On the other hand, "ratiometric-pericam" had an excitation

wavelength changing in a \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}-dependent manner. All of the

pericams expressed in HeLa cells were able to monitor free \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}

dynamics, such as \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} oscillations in the cytosol and the

nucleus. \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} imaging using high-speed confocal line-scanning

microscopy and a flash-pericam allowed to detect the free propagation

of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} ions across the nuclear envelope. Then, free \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}

concentrations in the nucleus and mitochondria were simultaneously

measured by using ratiometric-pericams having appropriate localization

signals, revealing that extra-mitochondrial \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} transients

caused rapid changes in the concentration of mitochondrial \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}.

Finally, a "split-pericam" was made by deleting the linker in the

flash-pericam. The \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}-dependent interaction between calmodulin

and M13 in HeLa cells was monitored by the association of the two

halves of GFP, neither of which was fluorescent by itself.},

A comparison of the RSVP technique using 100-ms presentations with that using a longer duration showed that shape preference can be determined with RSVP. Using relatively complex shapes that vary along relatively simple shape dimensions, we found that the large majority of neurons preferred extremes of the shape configuration, extending the results of a previous study using simpler shapes and a standard testing paradigm. A population analysis of the neuronal responses demonstrated that, in general, IT neurons can represent the similarities among the shapes at an ordinal level, extending a previous study that used a smaller number of shapes and a categorization task. However, the same analysis showed that IT neurons do not faithfully represent the physical similarities among the shapes. The responses to the two-part shapes could be predicted, virtually perfectly, from the average of the responses to the respective two parts presented in isolation. We also showed that IT neurons adapt to the stimulus distribution statistics. The neural shape discrimination improved when a shape set with a narrower stimulus range was presented, suggesting that the tuning of IT neurons is not static but adapts to the stimulus distribution statistics, at least when stimulated at a high rate with a restricted set of stimuli.},

abstract = {Successful adaptation relies on the ability to learn the consequence of our actions in different environments. However, understanding the neural bases of this ability still represents one of the great challenges of system neuroscience. In fact, the neuronal plasticity changes occurring during learning cannot be fully controlled experimentally and their evolution is hidden. Our approach is to provide hypotheses about the structure and dynamics of the hidden plasticity changes using behavioral learning theory. In fact, behavioral models of animal learning provide testable predictions about the hidden learning representations by formalizing their relation with the observables of the experiment (stimuli, actions and outcomes). Thus, we can understand whether and how the predicted learning processes are represented at the neural level by estimating their evolution and correlating them with neural data. Here, we present a bayesian model approach to estimate the evolution of the internal learning representations from the observations of the experiment (state estimation), and to identify the set of models' parameters (parameter estimation) and the class of behavioral model (model selection) that are most likely to have generated a given sequence of actions and outcomes. More precisely, we use Sequential Monte Carlo methods for state estimation and the maximum likelihood principle (MLP) for model selection and parameter estimation. We show that the method recovers simulated trajectories of learning sessions on a single-trial basis and provides predictions about the activity of different categories of neurons that should participate in the learning process. By correlating the estimated evolutions of the learning variables, we will be able to test the validity of different models of instrumental learning and possibly identify the neural bases of learning.},

abstract = {1. We have recorded the responses of neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of barbiturate-anesthetized cats to pure tones [either at the unit's best frequency (BF) or at another frequency (OFF-BF)] and to two-tone combination stimuli. 2. The effects of OFF-BF input (either alone or presented simultaneously with a BF tone in a two-tone stimulus) on the response patterns of choppers may include not only rate inhibition but changes in the discharge regularity and the temporal adaptation properties of the spike trains. 3. In the majority of cases we studied (119 of 146 frequencies examined in 45 units), the discharge regularity of a response to an OFF-BF or two-tone stimulus is comparable with that of a "rate-matched" BF tone response. In a minority of cases (27 of 146 frequencies examined), however, OFF-BF input (either alone or in a two-tone stimulus format) changed the regularity compared with that of a rate-matched BF tone response. 4. In the majority of cases studied (139 of 171 frequencies examined in 53 units), the initial pattern of rate adaptation ["temporal adaptation pattern" (TAP)] was the same in response to a short tone burst at BF, to an OFF-BF tone burst, or to a pair of tones. The TAP can, however, be significantly altered by OFF-BF input, although this is a comparatively infrequent occurrence in our data sample (32 of 171 frequencies examined), from the response to BF tone to the response to the two-tone or OFF-BF stimulus, are as follows: sustained to slowly adapting; slowly adapting to transiently adapting, and transiently adapting to slowly adapting. Changes in the TAPs of chopper unit responses have been recorded from both regular and irregular choppers and cannot be accounted for on the basis of changes in sustained firing rate. These changes in the discharge regularity and TAP in the small minority of cases suggest that (at least in these cases) the inhibitory effect of OFF-BF input is not simply the result of two-tone suppression at the level of the auditory nerve fiber input. 5. We have observed that regular choppers may be transformed into irregular choppers by OFF-BF (rate inhibitory) input.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Multiple factors simultaneously affect the spiking activity of individual neurons. Determining the effects and relative importance of these factors is a challenging problem in neurophysiology. We propose a statistical framework based on the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to three typical covariates: the neuron's own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and extrinsic covariates such as stimuli or behavior. The framework uses parametric models of the conditional intensity function to define a neuron's spiking probability in terms of the covariates. The discrete time likelihood function for point processes is used to carry out model fitting and model analysis. We show that, by modeling the logarithm of the conditional intensity function as a linear combination of functions of the covariates, the discrete time point process likelihood function is readily analyzed in the generalized linear model (GLM) framework. We illustrate our approach for both GLM and non-GLM likelihood functions using simulated data and multivariate single-unit activity data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of a monkey performing a visuomotor pursuit-tracking task. The point process framework provides a flexible, computationally efficient approach for maximum likelihood estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, residual analysis, model selection, and neural decoding. The framework thus allows for the formulation and analysis of point process models of neural spiking activity that readily capture the simultaneous effects of multiple covariates and enables the assessment of their relative importance.},

abstract = {The cochlear nucleus receives incoming auditory nerve discharges,

preserves or transforms the signals, and distributes outgoing activity

to higher centers. The organization of auditory nerve input to the

cochlear nucleus will heavily influence the mechanisms by which acoustic

information is processed. In order to study structure-function relationships

between auditory nerve and cochlear nucleus, the axonal arborizations

of type I spiral ganglion cells were labeled with intracellular injections

of horseradish peroxidase after first being electrophysiologically

characterized by recording with a micropipette inserted into the

axon. For each auditory nerve fiber, spontaneous discharge rate (SR)

and a frequency tuning curve were determined. The tuning curve yielded

the characteristic frequency (CF, that frequency to which the fiber

is most sensitive) and CF threshold in dB SPL. Individual axonal

arborizations including all terminal swellings were reconstructed

through serial sections with the aid of a light microscope and drawing

tube. On average, 13.4 +/- 8.1\% of the terminal swellings were found

in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and the remaining terminal swellings

were located in the ventral cochlear nucleus. In the DCN, the terminal

fields of auditory nerve fibers were restricted to layer III, contributed

to cytoarchitectonic striations, and exhibited a systematic relationship

between fiber CF and position along the strial (or long) axis of

the nucleus. Computer-aided rotations revealed that the terminal

fields were anisotropic, being flattened within the trans-strial

axis. The maximal width of the terminal fields along the strial axis

ranged from 31-321 microns and was inversely related to fiber CF

and SR. Variation in the number of terminals or depth of the terminal

field within layer III was not related to SR grouping or CF of the

fiber.},

abstract = {Studies of the avian auditory system indicate that neurons in nucleus

magnocellularis (NM) and nucleus laminaris of young animals are dramatically

altered by changes in the auditory receptor. We examined the role

of presynaptic activity on these transneuronal regulatory events.

TTX was used to block action potentials in the auditory nerve. TTX

injections into the perilymph reliably blocked all neuronal activity

in the cochlear nerve and NM. Far-field recordings of sound-evoked

potentials revealed that responses returned within 6-12 hr after

a single TTX injection. Changes in protein synthesis by NM neurons

were measured by determining the incorporation of 3H-leucine using

autoradiography. NM neurons on the side of the brain ipsilateral

to the TTX injection were compared to normally active cells on the

other side of the same tissue section. Grain counts over individual

neurons revealed that a single injection of TTX produced a 40\% decrease

in grain density in ipsilateral NM neurons within 1.5 hr after the

TTX injection. However, by 24 hr after a single TTX injection, grain

densities were not different on the 2 sides of the brain. Continuous

activity blockade for 6 hr caused the cessation of amino acid incorporation

in a portion of NM neurons and a 15-20\% decrease in the remaining

neurons. These changes in amino acid incorporation are comparable

to those following complete removal of the cochlea (Steward and Rubel,

1985). We also examined NM for neuron loss and soma shrinkage after

blocking eighth nerve action potentials. TTX injected every 12 hr

for 48 hr caused a 20\% neuron loss and an 8\% shrinkage of the remaining

neurons. Similar reductions were found following cochlea removal

(Born and Rubel, 1985). It is concluded that neuronal activity plays

a major role in the maintenance of normal NM neurons. Furthermore,

these results suggest that transneuronal morphological changes seen

in neurons following deafferentation or alterations of sensory experience

are a result of changes in the level of presynaptic activity.},

abstract = {1. The amino acid neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine function as inhibitory neurotransmitters associated with nonprimary inputs onto spherical bushy and stellate cells, two principal cell types located in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN). These neurons are characterized by primary-like (including phase-locked) and chopper temporal response patterns, respectively. 2. Inhibition directly adjacent to the excitatory response area has been hypothesized to sharpen or limit the breadth of the tonal frequency receptive field. This study was undertaken to test whether GABA and glycine circuits function primarily to sharpen the lateral edges of the tonal excitatory response area or to modulate discharge rate within central portions of the excitatory response area of AVCN neurons. 3. To test this, iontophoretic application of the glycineI antagonist, strychnine, or the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, was used to block inhibitory inputs after obtaining control families of isointensity contours (response areas) from extracellularly recorded AVCN neurons. 4. Blockade of GABA and/or glycine inputs was found to increase discharge rate primarily within the excitatory response area of neurons displaying chopper and primary-like temporal responses with little or no change in bandwidth or in off-characteristic frequency (CF) discharge rate. 5. The principal sources of inhibitory inputs onto AVCN neurons are cells located in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex, which appear to be tonotopically matched to their targets. In agreement with these morphological studies, the data presented in this paper suggest that most GABA and/or glycine inhibition is tonotopically aligned with excitatory inputs. 6. These findings support models that suggest that GABA and/or glycine inputs onto AVCN neurons are involved in circuits that adjust gain to enable the detection of signals in noise by enhancing signal relative to background.},

In this paper we develop appropriate techniques for analysis and visualization of such imaging data to separate the signal from the noise and characterize the signal. The techniques developed fall into the general category of multivariate time series analysis, and in particular we extensively use the multitaper framework of spectral analysis. We develop specific protocols for the analysis of fMRI, optical imaging, and MEG data, and illustrate the techniques by applications to real data sets generated by these imaging modalities. In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct stages: "noise" characterization and suppression, and "signal" characterization and visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is the utility of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving analysis windows to account for nonstationarity in the data. Of particular note are 1) the development of a decomposition technique (space-frequency singular value decomposition) that is shown to be a useful means of characterizing the image data, and 2) the development of an algorithm, based on multitaper methods, for the removal of approximately periodic physiological artifacts arising from cardiac and respiratory sources.},

In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation.

abstract = {Selecting features for multiclass classification is a critically important task for pattern recognition and machine learning applications. Especially challenging is selecting an optimal subset of features from high-dimensional data, which typically have many more variables than observations and contain significant noise, missing components, or outliers. Existing methods either cannot handle high-dimensional data efficiently or scalably, or can only obtain local optimum instead of global optimum. Toward the selection of the globally optimal subset of features efficiently, we introduce a new selector--which we call the Fisher-Markov selector--to identify those features that are the most useful in describing essential differences among the possible groups. In particular, in this paper we present a way to represent essential discriminating characteristics together with the sparsity as an optimization objective. With properly identified measures for the sparseness and discriminativeness in possibly high-dimensional settings, we take a systematic approach for optimizing the measures to choose the best feature subset. We use Markov random field optimization techniques to solve the formulated objective functions for simultaneous feature selection. Our results are noncombinatorial, and they can achieve the exact global optimum of the objective function for some special kernels. The method is fast; in particular, it can be linear in the number of features and quadratic in the number of observations. We apply our procedure to a variety of real-world data, including mid--dimensional optical handwritten digit data set and high-dimensional microarray gene expression data sets. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by experimental results. In pattern recognition and from a model selection viewpoint, our procedure says that it is possible to select the most discriminating subset of variables by solving a very simple unconstrained objective function which in fact can be obtained with an explicit expression.},

abstract = {The companion study showed that acoustic overstimulation of adult

chinchillas, with a noise level sufficient to damage the cochlea,

led to cytological changes and degeneration of synaptic endings in

the cochlear nucleus within 1-16 weeks. In the present study, the

same stimulus was used to study the long-term effects on the fine

structure of synaptic endings in the cochlear nucleus. For periods

of 6 and 8 months after a single exposure to a damaging noise level,

there ensued a chronic, continuing process of neurodegeneration involving

excitatory and inhibitory synaptic endings. Electron microscopic

observations demonstrated freshly occurring degeneration even as

late as 8 months. Degeneration was widespread in the neuropil and

included the synapses on the globular bushy cell, which forms part

of the main ascending auditory pathway. Neurodegeneration was accompanied

by newly formed synaptic endings, which repopulated some of the sites

vacated previously by axosomatic endings on globular bushy cells.

Many of these synaptic endings must arise from central interneurons.

The findings suggest that overstimulation can induce a self-sustaining

condition of progressive neurodegeneration accompanied by a new growth

of synaptic endings. Noise-induced hearing loss thus may progress

as a neurodegenerative disease with the capacity for synaptic reorganization

within the cochlear nucleus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Central neurocytoma (CN) represents a rare, relatively
recently described primary central nervous system tumor. It ranks
among intraventricular tumors due to its predominant location within
the lateral brain ventricles. CN occurs mostly in young adults around
the 3rd decade of life; almost a fifth of the cases are children
under 18 years of age. OBJECTIVES: The authors present three cases
of patients with histopathologically confirmed CN, emphasizing diagnostic
imaging issues. A review of the literature concerning differential
diagnosis and clinical and therapeutic aspects is also presented.
CONCLUSION: Literature reports of CN comprise most likely case reports,
small cohorts of patients, and meta-analytic studies due to the generally
low incidence of this tumor. In the current paper, the authors summarize
up-to-date knowledge of this rare disease on the background of their
own observations. CN should be included in the list for differential
diagnostics of intraventricular brain tumors, especially those located
in lateral ventricles.},

abstract = {Exact geometrical reconstructions of neuronal architecture are indispensable
for the investigation of neuronal function. Neuronal shape is important
for the wiring of networks, and dendritic architecture strongly affects
neuronal integration and firing properties as demonstrated by modeling
approaches. Confocal microscopy allows to scan neurons with submicron
resolution. However, it is still a tedious task to reconstruct complex
dendritic trees with fine structures just above voxel resolution.
We present a framework assisting the reconstruction. User time investment
is strongly reduced by automatic methods, which fit a skeleton and
a surface to the data, while the user can interact and thus keeps
full control to ensure a high quality reconstruction. The reconstruction
process composes a successive gain of metric parameters. First, a
structural description of the neuron is built, including the topology
and the exact dendritic lengths and diameters. We use generalized
cylinders with circular cross sections. The user provides a rough
initialization by marking the branching points. The axes and radii
are fitted to the data by minimizing an energy functional, which
is regularized by a smoothness constraint. The investigation of proximity
to other structures throughout dendritic trees requires a precise
surface reconstruction. In order to achieve accuracy of 0.1 microm
and below, we additionally implemented a segmentation algorithm based
on geodesic active contours that allow for arbitrary cross sections
and uses locally adapted thresholds. In summary, this new reconstruction
tool saves time and increases quality as compared to other methods,
which have previously been applied to real neurons.},

abstract = {The inferior colliculus is a central auditory structure which serves

as a site for the integration of ascending and descending auditory

information. Changes in central auditory structures may occur with

acoustic exposure, which cannot be explained by alterations in cochlear

function alone. Rats were exposed to a 10-kHz tone at 100 dB SPL

for 9 h. Auditory brainstem response measures showed an initial 25-30-dB

threshold shift across all tested frequencies. By 30 days post-exposure,

thresholds for clicks and most frequencies returned to near control

levels; however, thresholds remained elevated at 10 and 20 kHz. Inner

hair cell loss was confined to apical and basal ends of the cochlea,

and did not exceed 20\%. Inferior colliculus levels of the two isoforms

of the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (65,000 and

67,000 mol. wt forms) were measured immediately post-exposure (0

h) and at two and 30 days post-exposure using quantitative immunocytochemical

and western blotting techniques. Zero-hour measures revealed a significant

increase in the level of glutamate decarboxylase (mol. wt 67,000)

protein (118\%), as well as in the optical density (35\%) of immunolabeled

cells. By 30 days post-exposure, inferior colliculus protein levels

of both glutamate decarboxylase isoforms were significantly below

unexposed controls (39\% and 21\% for the 65,000 and 67,000 mol.

wt forms, respectively). These studies describe increased markers

for GABA immediately following acoustic exposure, followed by a decline

to below control levels from two to 30 days post-exposure. It remains

to be determined whether noise trauma-induced changes in glutamate

decarboxylase levels in the inferior colliculus reflect protective

up-regulation in response to intense stimulation, followed by the

establishment of new neurotransmitter equilibrium levels.},

Here we identify and develop an archaeal light-driven chloride pump (NpHR) from Natronomonas pharaonis for temporally precise optical inhibition of neural activity. NpHR allows either knockout of single action potentials, or sustained blockade of spiking. NpHR is compatible with ChR2, the previous optical excitation technology we have described, in that the two opposing probes operate at similar light powers but with well-separated action spectra. NpHR, like ChR2, functions in mammals without exogenous cofactors, and the two probes can be integrated with calcium imaging in mammalian brain tissue for bidirectional optical modulation and readout of neural activity. Likewise, NpHR and ChR2 can be targeted together to Caenorhabditis elegans muscle and cholinergic motor neurons to control locomotion bidirectionally. NpHR and ChR2 form a complete system for multimodal, high-speed, genetically targeted, all-optical interrogation of living neural circuits.},

In the presence of CCh (20 microM), initial bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients were followed by large propagating secondary Ca2+ transients that were restricted to proximal apical dendrites < or =40 microm from the soma. In middle apical dendrites (41-100 microm from the soma), Ca2+ transients evoked by AP bursts at 20 Hz, but not by single APs, were increased by CCh without secondary transients. CCh failed to increase the bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients in distal apical dendrites (101-270 microm from the soma). In contrast, in basal dendrites, CCh increased Ca2+ transients evoked by AP bursts, but not by single APs, and these transients were relatively constant over the entire length of the dendrites. CCh further increased the enhanced bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (200 microM), an A-type K+ channel blocker, in basal and apical dendrites, except in distal apical dendrites. CCh increased large Ca2+ transients evoked by high-frequency AP bursts in basal dendrites, but not in distal apical dendrites. CCh-induced increase in Ca2+ transients was mediated by InsP3-dependent Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release. These results suggest that cholinergic stimulation differentially increases the bAP-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i in apical and basal dendrites, which may modulate synaptic activities in a location-dependent manner.},

abstract = {We propose a regularized, fast, and robust analytical solution for the Q-ball imaging (QBI) reconstruction of the orientation distribution function (ODF) together with its detailed validation and a discussion on its benefits over the state-of-the-art. Our analytical solution is achieved by modeling the raw high angular resolution diffusion imaging signal with a spherical harmonic basis that incorporates a regularization term based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on the unit sphere. This leads to an elegant mathematical simplification of the Funk-Radon transform which approximates the ODF. We prove a new corollary of the Funk-Hecke theorem to obtain this simplification. Then, we show that the Laplace-Beltrami regularization is theoretically and practically better than Tikhonov regularization. At the cost of slightly reducing angular resolution, the Laplace-Beltrami regularization reduces ODF estimation errors and improves fiber detection while reducing angular error in the ODF maxima detected. Finally, a careful quantitative validation is performed against ground truth from synthetic data and against real data from a biological phantom and a human brain dataset. We show that our technique is also able to recover known fiber crossings in the human brain and provides the practical advantage of being up to 15 times faster than original numerical QBI method.},

abstract = {The auditory system uses three cues to decode sound location: interaural time differences (ITDs), interaural level differences (ILDs), and spectral notches (SNs). Initial processing of these cues is done in separate brainstem nuclei, with ITDs in the medial superior olive, ILDs in the lateral superior olive, and SNs in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. This work addresses the nature of the convergence of localization information in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC). Ramachandran et al. (1999) argued that ICC neurons of types V, I, and O, respectively, receive their predominant inputs from ITD-, ILD-, and SN-sensitive brainstem nuclei, suggesting that these ICC response types should be differentially sensitive to localization cues. Here, single-unit responses to simultaneous manipulation of pairs of localization cues were recorded, and the mutual information between discharge rate and individual cues was quantified. Although rate responses to cue variation were generally consistent with those expected from the hypothesized anatomical connections, the differences in information were not as large as expected. Type I units provide the most information, especially about SNs in the physiologically useful range. Type I and O units provide information about ILDs, even at low frequencies at which actual ILDs are very small. ITD information is provided by a subset of all low-frequency neurons. Type V neurons provide information mainly about ITDs and the average binaural intensity. These results are the first to quantify the relative representation of cues in terms of information and suggest a variety of degrees of cue integration in the ICC.},

abstract = {A central objective in neuroscience is to understand how neurons interact. Such functional interactions have been estimated using signals recorded with different techniques and, consequently, different temporal resolutions. For example, spike data often have sub-millisecond resolution while some imaging techniques may have a resolution of many seconds. Here we use multi-electrode spike recordings to ask how similar functional connectivity inferred from slower timescale signals is to the one inferred from fast timescale signals. We find that functional connectivity is relatively robust to low-pass filtering--dropping by about 10\% when low pass filtering at 10 hz and about 50\% when low pass filtering down to about 1 Hz--and that estimates are robust to high levels of additive noise. Moreover, there is a weak correlation for physiological filters such as hemodynamic or Ca2+ impulse responses and filters based on local field potentials. We address the origin of these correlations using simulation techniques and find evidence that the similarity between functional connectivity estimated across timescales is due to processes that do not depend on fast pair-wise interactions alone. Rather, it appears that connectivity on multiple timescales or common-input related to stimuli or movement drives the observed correlations. Despite this qualification, our results suggest that techniques with intermediate temporal resolution may yield good estimates of the functional connections between individual neurons.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging has undergone spectacular developments in recent years. Paradoxically, its neurobiological bases have remained elusive, resulting in an intense debate around the cellular mechanisms taking place upon activation that could contribute to the signals measured. Taking advantage of a modeling approach, we propose here a coherent neurobiological framework that not only explains several in vitro and in vivo observations but also provides a physiological basis to interpret imaging signals. First, based on a model of compartmentalized energy metabolism, we show that complex kinetics of NADH changes observed in vitro can be accounted for by distinct metabolic responses in two cell populations reminiscent of neurons and astrocytes. Second, extended application of the model to an in vivo situation allowed us to reproduce the evolution of intraparenchymal oxygen levels upon activation as measured experimentally without substantially altering the initial parameter values. Finally, applying the same model to functional neuroimaging in humans, we were able to determine that the early negative component of the blood oxygenation level-dependent response recorded with functional MRI, known as the initial dip, critically depends on the oxidative response of neurons, whereas the late aspects of the signal correspond to a combination of responses from cell types with two distinct metabolic profiles that could be neurons and astrocytes. In summary, our results, obtained with such a modeling approach, support the concept that both neuronal and glial metabolic responses form essential components of neuroimaging signals.},

One system gradually acquires reliable sequences of responses to given situations (e.g. repeatedly following a fixed route), and depends on the striatum. The other develops flexible representations permitting novel responses (e.g. finding new shortcuts), and depends on the hippocampus.

abstract = {Neural receptive fields are dynamic in that with experience, neurons change their spiking responses to relevant stimuli. To understand how neural systems adapt their representations of biological information, analyses of receptive field plasticity from experimental measurements are crucial. Adaptive signal processing, the well-established engineering discipline for characterizing the temporal evolution of system parameters, suggests a framework for studying the plasticity of receptive fields. We use the Bayes' rule Chapman-Kolmogorov paradigm with a linear state equation and point process observation models to derive adaptive filters appropriate for estimation from neural spike trains. We derive point process filter analogues of the Kalman filter, recursive least squares, and steepest-descent algorithms and describe the properties of these new filters. We illustrate our algorithms in two simulated data examples. The first is a study of slow and rapid evolution of spatial receptive fields in hippocampal neurons. The second is an adaptive decoding study in which a signal is decoded from ensemble neural spiking activity as the receptive fields of the neurons in the ensemble evolve. Our results provide a paradigm for adaptive estimation for point process observations and suggest a practical approach for constructing filtering algorithms to track neural receptive field dynamics on a millisecond timescale.},

Here we provide a description of fundamental quantitative principles governing neural selectivity for complex shape in IT. By measuring responses to large, parametric sets of two-dimensional (2D) silhouette shapes, we found that neurons in posterior IT (Brodmann's areas TEO and posterior TE) integrate information about multiple contour elements (straight and curved edge fragments of the type represented in lower-level areas) using both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. This results in complex, distributed response patterns that cannot be characterized solely in terms of example stimuli. We explained these response patterns with tuning functions in multidimensional shape space and accurately predicted neural responses to the widely varying shapes in our stimulus set. Integration of contour element information in earlier stages of IT represents an important step in the transformation from low-level shape signals to complex object representation.},

in the excited state predicts the existence of three-axial anisotropy
of the g-tensor even at the level of first-order perturbation theory;
two axes of the g-tensor located in a plane of three-coordinate structure
can rotate about the main z axis when a compound is distorted by
motion of ligands. It has been shown that in three points of the
potential energy surface minimum, for which linear and quadric constants
of the vibronic interactions have an identical signs, the HFS isotropic
constant from one ligand is larger than HFS constants from the other
two; for different vibronic constant signs the ratio between HFS

A neuronal classification system is essential to organize such data and the knowledge that is derived from them. Classification depends on the unequivocal identification of the features that distinguish one type of neuron from another. The problems inherent in this are particularly acute when studying cortical interneurons. To tackle this, we convened a representative group of researchers to agree on a set of terms to describe the anatomical, physiological and molecular features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex. The resulting terminology might provide a stepping stone towards a future classification of these complex and heterogeneous cells. Consistent adoption will be important for the success of such an initiative, and we also encourage the active involvement of the broader scientific community in the dynamic evolution of this project.},

of embryonic stem (ES) cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms
remain poorly defined. Here we characterize changes in mouse ES cells
lacking Dicer (Dicer1). Transcriptome analysis of Dicer-/- cells
indicates that the ES-specific miR-290 cluster has an important regulatory
function in undifferentiated ES cells. Consistently, many of the
defects in Dicer-deficient cells can be reversed by transfection
with miR-290 family miRNAs. We demonstrate that Oct4 (also known
as Pou5f1) silencing in differentiating Dicer-/- ES cells is accompanied
by accumulation of repressive histone marks but not by DNA methylation,
which prevents the stable repression of Oct4. The methylation defect
correlates with downregulation of de novo DNA methyltransferases
(Dnmts). The downregulation is mediated by Rbl2 and possibly other
transcriptional repressors, potential direct targets of miR-290 cluster
miRNAs. The defective DNA methylation can be rescued by ectopic expression
of de novo Dnmts or by transfection of the miR-290 cluster miRNAs,
indicating that de novo DNA methylation in ES cells is controlled
by miRNAs.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of multiunit recordings gives new urgency to the need for effective analysis of "multidimensional" time-series data that are derived from the recorded activity of neuronal ensembles in the form of multiple sequences of action potentials--treated mathematically as point-processes and computationally as spike-trains. Whether in conditions of spontaneous activity or under conditions of external stimulation, the objective is the identification and quantification of possible causal links among the neurons generating the observed binary signals. A multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) modeling methodology is presented that can be used to quantify the neuronal dynamics of causal interrelationships in neuronal ensembles using spike-train data recorded from individual neurons. These causal interrelationships are modeled as transformations of spike-trains recorded from a set of neurons designated as the "inputs" into spike-trains recorded from another set of neurons designated as the "outputs." The MIMO model is composed of a set of multiinput/single-output (MISO) modules, one for each output. Each module is the cascade of a MISO Volterra model and a threshold operator generating the output spikes. The Laguerre expansion approach is used to estimate the Volterra kernels of each MISO module from the respective input-output data using the least-squares method. The predictive performance of the model is evaluated with the use of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, from which the optimum threshold is also selected. The Mann-Whitney statistic is used to select the significant inputs for each output by examining the statistical significance of improvements in the predictive accuracy of the model when the respective inputs is included. Illustrative examples are presented for a simulated system and for an actual application using multiunit data recordings from the hippocampus of a behaving rat.},

These competing requisites include a somatotopic map of the body, a map of hand location in space, and a partitioning of cortex into regions that emphasize different complex, ethologically relevant movements. No one type of map fully explains the topography; instead, all three influences (and perhaps others untested here) interact to form the topography. A standard algorithm (Kohonen network) was used to generate an artificial motor cortex array that optimized local continuity for these conflicting mapping requisites. The resultant hybrid map contained many features seen in actual motor cortex, including the following: a rough, overlapping somatotopy; a posterior strip in which simpler movements were represented and more somatotopic segregation was observed, and an anterior strip in which more complex, multisegmental movements were represented and the somatotopy was less segregated; a clustering of different complex, multisegmental movements into specific subregions of cortex that resembled the arrangement of subregions found in the monkey; three hand representations arranged on the cortex in a manner similar to the primary motor, dorsal premotor, and ventral premotor hand areas in the monkey; and maps of hand location that approximately matched the maps observed in the monkey.},

Graph theory predicts that scale-free topologies, which include "hubs" (superconnected nodes), are an effective design to orchestrate synchronization. Whether hubs are present in neuronal assemblies and coordinate network activity remains unknown. Using network dynamics imaging, online reconstruction of functional connectivity, and targeted whole-cell recordings in rats and mice, we found that developing hippocampal networks follow a scale-free topology, and we demonstrated the existence of functional hubs. Perturbation of a single hub influenced the entire network dynamics. Morphophysiological analysis revealed that hub cells are a subpopulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing (GABAergic) interneurons possessing widespread axonal arborizations. These findings establish a central role for GABAergic interneurons in shaping developing networks and help provide a conceptual framework for studying neuronal synchrony.},

abstract = {Humans demonstrate a remarkable ability to generate accurate and appropriate motor behavior under many different and often uncertain environmental conditions. We previously proposed a new modular architecture, the modular selection and identification for control (MOSAIC) model, for motor learning and control based on multiple pairs of forward (predictor) and inverse (controller) models. The architecture simultaneously learns the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the set of inverse models appropriate for a given environment. It combines both feedforward and feedback sensorimotor information so that the controllers can be selected both prior to movement and subsequently during movement. This article extends and evaluates the MOSAIC architecture in the following respects. The learning in the architecture was implemented by both the original gradient-descent method and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Unlike gradient descent, the newly derived EM algorithm is robust to the initial starting conditions and learning parameters. Second, simulations of an object manipulation task prove that the architecture can learn to manipulate multiple objects and switch between them appropriately. Moreover, after learning, the model shows generalization to novel objects whose dynamics lie within the polyhedra of already learned dynamics. Finally, when each of the dynamics is associated with a particular object shape, the model is able to select the appropriate controller before movement execution. When presented with a novel shape-dynamic pairing, inappropriate activation of modules is observed followed by on-line correction.},

abstract = {In the study of complex mammalian behaviours, technological limitations have prevented spatiotemporally precise control over intracellular signalling processes. Here we report the development of a versatile family of genetically encoded optical tools ('optoXRs') that leverage common structure-function relationships among G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to recruit and control, with high spatiotemporal precision, receptor-initiated biochemical signalling pathways. In particular, we have developed and characterized two optoXRs that selectively recruit distinct, targeted signalling pathways in response to light. The two optoXRs exerted opposing effects on spike firing in nucleus accumbens in vivo, and precisely timed optoXR photostimulation in nucleus accumbens by itself sufficed to drive conditioned place preference in freely moving mice. The optoXR approach allows testing of hypotheses regarding the causal impact of biochemical signalling in behaving mammals, in a targetable and temporally precise manner.},

Our decision trees optimize misclassification rate by invoking a local dimensionality reduction-based partitioning metric in the early stages, focusing on classification only in the leaves of the tree.

abstract = {A functional holography (FH) approach is introduced for analyzing
the complex activity of biological networks in the space of functional
correlations. Although the activity is often recorded from part of
the nodes only, the goal is to decipher the activity of the whole
network. This is why the analysis is guided by the \"{\i}¾“whole in every
part\"{\i}¾” nature of a holograms\^{A}—a small part of a hologram will generate
the whole picture but with lower resolution. The analysis is started
by constructing the space of functional correlations from the similarities
between the activities of the network components using a special
collective normalization or affinity transformation. Using dimension
reduction algorithms like PCA, a connectivity diagram is generated
in the 3-dimensional space of the leading eigenvectors of the algorithm.
The network components are positioned in the 3-dimensional space
by projection on the eigenvectors and connect them with colored lines
that represent the similarities. Temporal (causal) information is
superimposed by coloring the node\"{\i}¾’s locations according to the
temporal ordering of their activities. Utilizing the analysis, the
existence of hidden manifolds with simple yet characteristic geometrical
and topological features in the complex biological activity was discovered
from cultured networks to the human brain. These findings could be
a consequence of the analysis being consistent with a new holographic
principle by which biological networks regulate their complex activity.},

Here we review both current and prospective reverse genetic techniques that are applicable to the zebrafish model. We include discussion of pharmacological approaches, popular gain-of-function and knockdown approaches, and gene targeting strategies. We consider the need for temporal and spatial control over gain/loss of gene function, and discuss available and developing techniques to achieve this end.

tumor of B16F10 melanoma-bearing C57/BL6 mice was compared with anesthetized
and non-treated animals. Subpopulations of leukocytes were analyzed
using the flow cytometry, and the cytotoxic activity of splenocytes
against syngeneic B16F10 melanoma and NK-sensitive YAC-1 tumor cell
lines was evaluated in (51)Cr-release assay. Similarly, the in vitro
modification of the heat treatment was performed using healthy and
melanoma-bearing splenocytes. We found a 40 \% increase of activated
monocytes (CD11b+CD69+) infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.
In the spleen of experimental animals, the numbers of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTLs-CD3+CD8+) and NK cell (CD49b+NK1.1+) raised by
22 \% and 14 \%, respectively, while the NK1.1+ monocytes decreases
by 37 \%. This was accompanied by an enhancement of cytotoxic effector
function against B16F10 and YAC-1 targets in both in vivo and in
vitro conditions. These results demonstrate that LHT induces better
killing of syngeneic melanoma targets. Furthermore, LHT evokes the
homing of activated monocytes into the tumor microenvironment and
increases the counts of NK cells and CTL in the spleen.},

Resolving this question has proven difficult, in large part because of the sizeable uncertainty inherent in estimating or measuring the joint torques and muscle forces that underlie movements made by biological limbs. We circumvented this difficulty by considering single-neuron responses in an isometric task, where joint torques and muscle forces can be straightforwardly computed from limb geometry. The response for each neuron was modeled as a linear function of a "preferred" joint torque vector, and this model was fit to individual neural responses across variations in limb posture. The resulting goodness of fit suggests that neurons in motor cortex do encode the kinetics of motor behavior and that the neural response properties of "preferred direction" and "gain" are dual components of a unitary response vector.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the efficacy of a new spike-sorting method based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm by applying it to real data recorded from Purkinje cells (PCs) in young rat cerebellar slices. This algorithm is unique in its capability to estimate and make use of the firing statistics as well as the spike amplitude dynamics of the recorded neurons. PCs exhibit multiple discharge states, giving rise to multi-modal inter-spike interval (ISI) histograms and to correlations between successive ISIs. The amplitude of the spikes generated by a PC in an "active" state decreases, a feature typical of many neurons from both vertebrates and invertebrates. These two features constitute a major and recurrent problem for all the presently available spike-sorting methods. We first show that a hidden Markov model with three log-normal states provides a flexible and satisfying description of the complex firing of single PCs. We then incorporate this model into our previous MCMC based spike-sorting algorithm [Pouzat C, Delescluse M, Viot P, Diebolt J. Improved spike-sorting by modeling firing statistics and burst-dependent spike amplitude attenuation: a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. J Neurophysiol 2004;91:2910-28] and test this new algorithm on multi-unit recordings of bursting PCs.

abstract = {Various chemical modifications to RNA have been incorporated in attempts
to improve their pharmacological properties for RNAi interference
(RNAi). Recent studies have shown that small interfering RNA (siRNA)
containing 2'-fluoro modifications can elicit gene silencing through
RNAi. Despite developments in using chemical modifications for increased
stability, safety, and efficiency of these therapeutics, they still
face challenges of spatial and temporal targeting. One potential
targeting strategy is to use photocaging techniques, which involve
the covalent attachment of photolabile compounds to the effector
nucleic acid species that block bioactivity until exposed to near
UV light. In this study we demonstrate that fully 2'-fluorinated
nucleic acids (FNAs) can be caged for photoactivated gene silencing
in cell culture and in zebrafish embryos. This strategy combines
the improvement in chemical and enzymatic stability associated with
2'-substitutions with the targeting ability of a photoinducible trigger.
Statistical alkylation of FNAs with 1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane
(DMNPE) improved resistance to enzymatic degradation, reduced RNAi
effectiveness, and protected the biological system from toxic doses
of the effector. Photo-exposure to 365 nm light partially restored
the silencing activity of the 2'-fluoro siRNAs. These results suggest
that photocaging may offer control over RNAi therapeutics for spatially
and temporally directed activation, while improving enzymatic stability
and potentially enabling therapeutic dosing via light dose intensity.},

Previous green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based probes have had limited success in recording electrical activity of neurons because of their low sensitivity and poor temporal resolution. Here we describe a hybrid approach that combines a genetically encoded fluorescent probe (membrane-anchored enhanced GFP) with dipicrylamine, a synthetic voltage-sensing molecule that partitions into the plasma membrane. The movement of the synthetic voltage sensor is translated via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) into a large fluorescence signal (up to 34\% change per 100 mV) with a fast response and recovery time (0.5 ms). Using this two-component approach, we were able to optically record action potentials from neuronal cell lines and trains of action potentials from primary cultured neurons. This hybrid approach may form the basis for a new generation of protein-based voltage probes.},

abstract = {The nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans is arranged as a series
of fibre bundles which run along internal hypodermal ridges. Most
of the sensory integration takes place in a ring of nerve fibres
which is wrapped round the pharynx in the head. The body muscles
in the head are innervated by motor neurones in this nerve ring while
those in the lower part of the body are innervated by a set of motor
neurones in a longitudinal fibre bundle which joins the nerve ring,
the ventral cord. These motor neurones can be put into five classes
on the basis of their morphology and synaptic input. At any one point
along the cord only one member from each class has neuromuscular
junctions. Members of a given class are arranged in a regular linear
sequence in the cord and have non-overlapping fields of motor synaptic
activity, the transition between fields of adjacent neurones being
sharp and well defined. Members of a given class form gap junctions
with neighbouring members of the same class but never to motor neurones
of another class. Three of the motor neurone classes receive their
synaptic input from a set of interneurones coming from the nerve
ring. These interneurones can in turn be grouped into four classes
and each of three motor neurone classes receives its synaptic input
from a unique combination of interneurone classes. The possible developmental
and functional significance of these observations is discussed.},

@article{Ventura2009,
abstract = {Much of neuroscience has to do with relating neural activity and behavior or environment. One common measure of this relationship is the firing rates of neurons as functions of behavioral or environmental parameters, often called tuning functions and receptive fields. Firing rates are estimated from the spike trains of neurons recorded by electrodes implanted in the brain. Individual neurons' spike trains are not typically readily available, because the signal collected at an electrode is often a mixture of activities from different neurons and noise. Extracting individual neurons' spike trains from voltage signals, which is known as spike sorting, is one of the most important data analysis problems in neuroscience, because it has to be undertaken prior to any analysis of neurophysiological data in which more than one neuron is believed to be recorded on a single electrode. All current spike-sorting methods consist of clustering the characteristic spike waveforms of neurons. The sequence of first spike sorting based on waveforms, then estimating tuning functions, has long been the accepted way to proceed. Here, we argue that the covariates that modulate tuning functions also contain information about spike identities, and that if tuning information is ignored for spike sorting, the resulting tuning function estimates are biased and inconsistent, unless spikes can be classified with perfect accuracy. This means, for example, that the commonly used peristimulus time histogram is a biased estimate of the firing rate of a neuron that is not perfectly isolated. We further argue that the correct conceptual way to view the problem out is to note that spike sorting provides information about rate estimation and vice versa, so that the two relationships should be considered simultaneously rather than sequentially. Indeed we show that when spike sorting and tuning-curve estimation are performed in parallel, unbiased estimates of tuning curves can be recovered even from imperfectly sorted neurons.},

@article{Ostasov2008a,
abstract = {The molecular mechanisms involved in GPCR-initiated signaling cascades
where the two receptors share the same signaling cascade, such as
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and angiotensin II (ANG II),
are still far from being understood. Here, we analyzed hormone-induced
Ca(2+) responses and the process of desensitization in HEK-293 cells,
which express endogenous ANG II receptors. These cells were transfected
to express exogenously high levels of TRH receptors (clone E2) or
both TRH receptors and G(11)alpha protein (clone E2M11). We observed
that the characteristics of the Ca(2+) response, as well as the process
of desensitization, were both strongly dependent on receptor number
and G(11)alpha protein level. Whereas treatment of E2 cells with
TRH or ANG II led to significant desensitization of the Ca(2+) response
to subsequent addition of either hormone, the response was not desensitized
in E2M11 cells expressing high levels of G(11)alpha. In addition,
stimulation of both cell lines with THR elicited a clear heterologous
desensitization to subsequent stimulation with ANG II. On the other
hand, ANG II did not affect a subsequent response to TRH. ANG II-mediated
signal transduction was strongly dependent on plasma membrane integrity
modified by cholesterol depletion, but signaling through TRH receptors
was altered only slightly under these conditions. It may be concluded
that the level of expression of G-protein-coupled receptors and their
cognate G-proteins strongly influences not only the magnitude of
the Ca(2+) response but also the process of desensitization and resistance
to subsequent hormone addition.},

In the presence of CCh (20 microM), initial bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients were followed by large propagating secondary Ca2+ transients that were restricted to proximal apical dendrites < or =40 microm from the soma. In middle apical dendrites (41-100 microm from the soma), Ca2+ transients evoked by AP bursts at 20 Hz, but not by single APs, were increased by CCh without secondary transients. CCh failed to increase the bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients in distal apical dendrites (101-270 microm from the soma). In contrast, in basal dendrites, CCh increased Ca2+ transients evoked by AP bursts, but not by single APs, and these transients were relatively constant over the entire length of the dendrites. CCh further increased the enhanced bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (200 microM), an A-type K+ channel blocker, in basal and apical dendrites, except in distal apical dendrites. CCh increased large Ca2+ transients evoked by high-frequency AP bursts in basal dendrites, but not in distal apical dendrites. CCh-induced increase in Ca2+ transients was mediated by InsP3-dependent Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release. These results suggest that cholinergic stimulation differentially increases the bAP-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i in apical and basal dendrites, which may modulate synaptic activities in a location-dependent manner.},

There was considerable preparation-to-preparation variability in the strength of two identified synapses, in the amplitude of a modulator-evoked current and in the expression of six ion channel genes. Nonetheless, we found strong correlations across preparations among these parameters and attributes of circuit performance.

abstract = {Behavioral studies suggest that making a decision involves representing the overall desirability of all available actions and then selecting that action that is most desirable. Physiological studies have proposed that neurons in the parietal cortex play a role in selecting movements for execution. To test the hypothesis that these parietal neurons encode the subjective desirability of making particular movements, we exploited Nash's game theoretic equilibrium, during which the subjective desirability of multiple actions should be equal for human players. Behavior measured during a strategic game suggests that monkeys' choices, like those of humans, are guided by subjective desirability. Under these conditions, activity in the parietal cortex was correlated with the relative subjective desirability of actions irrespective of the specific combination of reward magnitude, reward probability, and response probability associated with each action. These observations may help place many recent findings regarding the posterior parietal cortex into a common conceptual framework.},

abstract = {Activity-dependent elevation of calcium within presynaptic boutons

regulates many aspects of synaptic transmission. Here, we examine

presynaptic residual calcium (Ca(res)) transients in individual presynaptic

boutons of cerebellar granule cells at near-physiological temperatures

using two-photon microscopy. Properties of Ca(res) under conditions

of zero-added buffer were determined by measuring Ca(res) transients

while loading boutons to a steady-state indicator concentration.

These experiments revealed that, in the absence of exogenous calcium

buffers, a single action potential evokes transients of Ca(res) that

vary widely in different boutons both in amplitude (400-900 nM) and

time course (25-55 ms). Variation in calcium influx density, endogenous

buffer capacity, and calcium extrusion density contribute to differences

in Ca(res) among boutons. Heterogeneity in Ca(res) within different

boutons suggests that plasticity can be regulated independently at

different synapses arising from an individual granule cell. In a

given bouton, Ca(res) signals were highly reproducible from trial

to trial and failures of calcium influx were not observed. We find

that a factor contributing to this reliability is that an action

potential opens a large number of calcium channels (20-125) in a

bouton. Presynaptic calcium signals were also used to assess the

ability of granule cell axons to convey somatically generated action

potentials to distant synapses. In response to pairs of action potentials

or trains, granule cell boutons showed a remarkable ability to respond

reliably at frequencies up to 500 Hz. Thus, individual boutons appear

specialized for reliable calcium signaling during bursts of high-frequency

activation such as those that are observed in vivo.},

abstract = {Most studies investigating neural representations of species-specific vocalizations in non-human primates and other species have involved studying neural responses to vocalization tokens. One limitation of such approaches is the difficulty in determining which acoustical features of vocalizations evoke neural responses. Traditionally used filtering techniques are often inadequate in manipulating features of complex vocalizations. Furthermore, the use of vocalization tokens cannot fully account for intrinsic stochastic variations of vocalizations that are crucial in understanding the neural codes for categorizing and discriminating vocalizations differing along multiple feature dimensions. In this work, we have taken a rigorous and novel approach to the study of species-specific vocalization processing by creating parametric "virtual vocalization" models of major call types produced by the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The main findings are as follows. 1) Acoustical parameters were measured from a database of the four major call types of the common marmoset. This database was obtained from eight different individuals, and for each individual, we typically obtained hundreds of samples of each major call type. 2) These feature measurements were employed to parameterize models defining representative virtual vocalizations of each call type for each of the eight animals as well as an overall species-representative virtual vocalization averaged across individuals for each call type. 3) Using the same feature-measurement that was applied to the vocalization samples, we measured acoustical features of the virtual vocalizations, including features not explicitly modeled and found the virtual vocalizations to be statistically representative of the callers and call types. 4) The accuracy of the virtual vocalizations was further confirmed by comparing neural responses to real and synthetic virtual vocalizations recorded from awake marmoset auditory cortex. We found a strong agreement between the responses to token vocalizations and their synthetic counterparts. 5) We demonstrated how these virtual vocalization stimuli could be employed to precisely and quantitatively define the notion of vocalization "selectivity" by using stimuli with parameter values both within and outside the naturally occurring ranges. We also showed the potential of the virtual vocalization stimuli in studying issues related to vocalization categorizations by morphing between different call types and individual callers.},

abstract = {The auditory neural code must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require great sensitivity in time and frequency and be effective over the diverse array of sounds present in natural acoustic environments. It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

patterns of connectivity that stabilize stimulus-selective reverberations

studying the process of learning and memorizing of patterns of mean
spike rates. General considerations based on the limitations of material
(biological or electronic)synaptic devices show that most learning
networks share the palimpsest property: old stimuli are forgotten
to make room for the new ones. In order to prevent too-fast forgetting,
one can introduce a stochastic mechanism for selecting only a small
fraction of synapses to be changed upon the presentation of a stimulus.
Such a mechanism can be easily implemented by exploiting the noisy
fluctuations in the pre- and postsynaptic activities to be encoded.
The spike-driven synaptic dynamics described here can implement such
a selection mechanism to achieve slow learning, which is shown to
maximize the performance of the network as an associative memory.},

abstract = {The organization of CA1 projections to the rat subiculum was investigated
with the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L).
Discrete iontophoretic injections of PHA-L were placed into various
transverse positions of the CA1 field at different septotemporal
levels of the hippocampus. The distribution of CA1 projections was
observed in dissected and extended hippocampal preparations. CA1
cells located proximally in the field, i.e., close to the CA2 field,
gave rise to projections that terminated in the distal third of the
subiculum, i.e., close to the presubiculum. CA1 cells located distally
in the field, i.e., close to the subiculum, gave rise to projections
that terminated proximally in the subiculum, i.e., just across the
CA1/subiculum border. CA1 cells in the middle of the field projected
to a midtransverse portion of the subiculum. The same general pattern
of projections was observed at all septotemporal levels of the hippocampus.
Varicose fibers from the CA1 neurons terminated among the basal dendrites
of the subicular pyramidal cells, within the pyramidal cell layer,
and in the deep portion of the molecular layer. In addition to the
CA1 to subiculum projections, the discrete PHA-L injections provided
the opportunity of examining the extent of local and associational
connections within CA1. In general, associational connections in
CA1 are far less extensive than in CA3. CA1 is not entirely without
local connections, however. CA1 cells located close to the subicular
border, for example, originated axons that first innervated the proximal
subiculum and then reentered the CA1 field at the interface between
stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare. In most of the
experimental cases, there were collaterals located in stratum oriens
of CA1 that branched from the fibers directed toward the subiculum.
Thus, the basal dendrites of CA1 cells may receive associational
inputs. The organization of the CA1 projections to the subiculum
is discussed in relation to the organization of CA3 projections to
CA1 and the differential output of transverse regions of the subiculum.
The possibility is raised that information may be "channeled" through
the hippocampal formation via the transverse organization of these
connections and ultimately distributed to different recipients of
hippocampal efferent projections.},

abstract = {We present an automatic subpixel registration algorithm that minimizes the mean square intensity difference between a reference and a test data set, which can be either images (two-dimensional) or volumes (three-dimensional). It uses an explicit spline representation of the images in conjunction with spline processing, and is based on a coarse-to-fine iterative strategy (pyramid approach). The minimization is performed according to a new variation (ML*) of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear least-square optimization. The geometric deformation model is a global three-dimensional (3-D) affine transformation that can be optionally restricted to rigid-body motion (rotation and translation), combined with isometric scaling. It also includes an optional adjustment of image contrast differences. We obtain excellent results for the registration of intramodality positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We conclude that the multiresolution refinement strategy is more robust than a comparable single-stage method, being less likely to be trapped into a false local optimum. In addition, our improved version of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm is faster.},

and correlated with supra-linear [Ca2+]i changes during one cycle

in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). While the increase

activity was required for the induction of supra-linear [Ca2+]i signals
shown to be necessary for LTP, the change in the baseline-to-peak

was not critical in this process. At different dendritic locations,
the baseline-to-peak amplitude of the bAP could be either increased,
decreased or unaltered at sites where EPSP-AP pairing evoked supra-linear

boosting or the reduction of the bAP, depending on the initial size

This is a significant problem for imaging or optically manipulating neural circuits, since neuronal activity is fast. To help surmount this limitation, we have developed a "scanless" microscope that does not contain mechanically moving parts. This microscope uses a diffractive spatial light modulator (SLM) to shape an incoming two-photon laser beam into any arbitrary light pattern. This allows the simultaneous imaging or photostimulation of different regions of a sample with three-dimensional precision. To demonstrate the usefulness of this microscope, we perform two-photon uncaging of glutamate to activate dendritic spines and cortical neurons in brain slices. We also use it to carry out fast (60 Hz) two-photon calcium imaging of action potentials in neuronal populations. Thus, SLM microscopy appears to be a powerful tool for imaging and optically manipulating neurons and neuronal circuits. Moreover, the use of SLMs expands the flexibility of laser microscopy, as it can substitute traditional simple fixed lenses with any calculated lens function.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for reconstructing binary images from their
projections along a small number of directions. Our algorithm performs
a sequence of related reconstructions, each using only two projections.
The algorithm makes extensive use of network flow algorithms for
solving the two-projection subproblems. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the algorithm can compute highly accurate reconstructions
from a small number of projections, even in the presence of noise.
Although the effectiveness of the algorithm is based on certain smoothness
assumptions about the image, even tiny, non-smooth details are reconstructed
exactly. The class of images for which the algorithm is most effective
includes images of convex objects, but images of objects that contain
holes or consist of multiple components can also be reconstructed
very well.},

abstract = {DNA photorepair has been widely studied in simple aquatic organisms
that live in the marine environment, but is less understood in more
complex species that live in freshwater. In the present study, we
evaluated UVA-induced DNA photo recovery in embryonic stages of zebrafish,
Danio rerio, a freshwater model species. Evaluation of UVB exposure
and UVA photo recovery of zebrafish embryos revealed different UVB
tolerances and capacities for UVA photo recovery at different stages
of development. Effective UVA photo recovery was observed at 3h post-fertilization
(hpf), 6-7 hpf, and 12 hpf, but not in the early cleavage stage (2-32
cells). UVA photo recovery was most effective during the gastrula
stage (6-7 hpf) of development, and less effective at earlier stages
(e.g., 3 hpf) or later stages (e.g., 12 hpf). Embryos at the cleavage
stage of development were found to be tolerant to extreme levels
of UVB exposure, and possible mechanisms were discussed. For embryos
at 6-7 hpf, examination of time window (or delay of UVA exposure)
that would still permit recovery from UVB exposure suggested a short
time period of 2h. The transgenic fli-1 zebrafish with fluorescent
vascular structure was used to show that embryos with normal morphological
appearance could exhibit a disrupted vascular patterning, suggesting
that this endpoint could provide a sensitive tool for detection of
UV damage.},

abstract = {Studies of cortical neurons in monkeys performing short-term memory tasks have shown that information about a stimulus can be maintained by persistent neuron firing for periods of many seconds after removal of the stimulus. The mechanism by which this sustained activity is initiated and maintained is unknown. In this article we present a spiking neural network model of short-term memory and use it to investigate the hypothesis that recurrent, or "re-entrant," networks with constant connection strengths are sufficient to store graded information temporarily. The synaptic weights that enable the network to mimic the input-output characteristics of an active memory module are computed using an optimization procedure for recurrent networks with non-spiking neurons. This network is then transformed into one with spiking neurons by interpreting the continuous output values of the nonspiking model neurons as spiking probabilities. The behavior of the model neurons in this spiking network is compared with that of 179 single units previously recorded in monkey inferotemporal (IT) cortex during the performance of a short-term memory task. The spiking patterns of almost every model neuron are found to resemble closely those of IT neurons. About 40\% of the IT neuron firing patterns are also found to be of the same types as those of model neurons. A property of the spiking model is that the neurons cannot maintain precise graded activity levels indefinitely, but eventually relax to one of a few constant activities called fixed-point attractors. The noise introduced into the model by the randomness of spiking causes the network to jump between these attractors. This switching between attractor states generates spike trains with a characteristic statistical temporal structure. We found evidence for the same kind of structure in the spike trains from about half of the IT neurons in our test set. These results show that the behavior of many real cortical memory neurons is consistent with an active storage mechanism based on recurrent activity in networks with fixed synaptic strengths.},

However, large fluorescence signals are obtained only at high DPA concentrations (>3 mum) that increase membrane capacitance to a level that suppresses neural activity. Here, we develop a quantitative model of the sensor to guide its optimization and achieved an approximate threefold increase in fractional fluorescence change at a lower DPA concentration of 2 mum. Using this optimized voltage reporter, we perform optical recordings of evoked activity in the Drosophila antennal lobe with millisecond temporal resolution but fail to detect action potentials, presumably because spike initiation and/or propagation are inhibited by the capacitive load added even at reduced DPA membrane densities. We evaluate strategies for potential further improvement of hVOS quantitatively and derive theoretical performance limits for optical voltage reporters in general.},

They are used for making quantitative measurements of intracellular free calcium both in vitro and in vivo, as well as measuring membrane potentials, pH, and other important physiological variables of interest to researchers in many subfields. Often, functional changes in the fluorescent yield of ratiometric indicators are small, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is of order unity or less. In particular, variability in the denominator of the ratio can lead to very poor ratio estimates. We present a statistical optimization method for objectively detecting and estimating ratiometric signals in dual-wavelength measurements of fluorescent, ratiometric indicators that improves on standard methods. With the use of an appropriate statistical model for ratiometric signals and by taking the pixel-pixel covariance of an imaging dataset into account, we are able to extract user-independent spatiotemporal information that retains high resolution in both space and time.},

abstract = {Tumor cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to
convert from a benign to a malignant phenotype. Our recent focus
has been signaling pathways that promote EMT in response to collagen.
We have shown that human pancreatic cancer cells respond to collagen
by up-regulating N-cadherin, which promotes tumor growth, invasion,
and metastasis. Initial characterization showed that knocking down
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase prevented N-cadherin up-regulation and
limited tumor growth and invasion in a mouse model for pancreatic
cancer. The current study was designed to understand the pathway
from collagen to N-cadherin up-regulation. Initiation of the signal
requires two collagen receptors, alpha2beta1 integrin and discoidin
domain receptor (DDR) 1. Each receptor propagates signals through
separate pathways that converge to up-regulate N-cadherin. Focal
adhesion kinase (FAK)-related protein tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) is downstream
of DDR1, whereas FAK is downstream of alpha2beta1 integrin. Both
receptor complexes rely on the p130 Crk-associated substrate scaffold.
Interestingly, Rap1, but not Rho family guanosine triphosphatases,
is required for the response to collagen I.},

abstract = {Circuitry mapping of metazoan neural systems is difficult because canonical neural regions (regions containing one or more copies of all components) are large, regional borders are uncertain, neuronal diversity is high, and potential network topologies so numerous that only anatomical ground truth can resolve them. Complete mapping of a specific network requires synaptic resolution, canonical region coverage, and robust neuronal classification. Though transmission electron microscopy (TEM) remains the optimal tool for network mapping, the process of building large serial section TEM (ssTEM) image volumes is rendered difficult by the need to precisely mosaic distorted image tiles and register distorted mosaics. Moreover, most molecular neuronal class markers are poorly compatible with optimal TEM imaging. Our objective was to build a complete framework for ultrastructural circuitry mapping. This framework combines strong TEM-compliant small molecule profiling with automated image tile mosaicking, automated slice-to-slice image registration, and gigabyte-scale image browsing for volume annotation. Specifically we show how ultrathin molecular profiling datasets and their resultant classification maps can be embedded into ssTEM datasets and how scripted acquisition tools (SerialEM), mosaicking and registration (ir-tools), and large slice viewers (MosaicBuilder, Viking) can be used to manage terabyte-scale volumes. These methods enable large-scale connectivity analyses of new and legacy data. In well-posed tasks (e.g., complete network mapping in retina), terabyte-scale image volumes that previously would require decades of assembly can now be completed in months. Perhaps more importantly, the fusion of molecular profiling, image acquisition by SerialEM, ir-tools volume assembly, and data viewers/annotators also allow ssTEM to be used as a prospective tool for discovery in nonneural systems and a practical screening methodology for neurogenetics. Finally, this framework provides a mechanism for parallelization of ssTEM imaging, volume assembly, and data analysis across an international user base, enhancing the productivity of a large cohort of electron microscopists.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that different solutions for submucosal
injection may influence early healing of endoscopic mucosal resection
(EMR). The aim of this study was to evaluate histological and immunological
changes after EMR in experimental pigs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two
parallel EMRs on the anterior and posterior wall of the gastric body
were performed by means of the cap technique in 21 female pigs. A
glycerol-based solution (anterior EMR) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
solution (posterior EMR) were applied for submucosal injection. The
animals were sacrificed 7 days later, and tissue sections of all
EMRs were stained using combined trichrome. Computer image analysis
was used for objective evaluation of elastic and collagen fibres
content. Two-colour indirect immunophenotyping of blood and gastric
samples were performed using mouse anti-pig monoclonal antibodies.
RESULTS: The values of collagen fibre content 7 days after EMR were
significantly higher in lesions after the use of solution A in comparison
with solution B (2.10 +/- 0.25\% versus 1.57 +/- 0.25\%, p = 0.009).
Concordant results were found in elastic fibres (3.23 +/- 0.49\%
versus 2.93 +/- 0.61\%, p = 0.018). No systemic changes in major
leukocyte subpopulations were found. In gastric tissue, lymphocyte
subsets exhibited only minor changes. CD4(+) T-lymphocytes were increased
in the healing tissue after EMR using solution A (17.08 +/- 9.24\%
versus 9.76 +/- 7.97\%, p = 0.011). Significant increase of SWC3(+)
leukocytes was observed after EMR using solution B (47.70 +/- 25.41\%
versus 18.70 +/- 12.16\%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of glycerol-based
solution for submucosal injection was associated with more pronounced
histological signs of early healing of EMRs compared with hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose.},

abstract = {Contrary to findings in subcortical auditory nuclei, auditory cortex neurons have traditionally been described as spiking only at the onsets of simple sounds such as pure tones or bandpass noise and to acoustic transients in complex sounds. Furthermore, primary auditory cortex (A1) has traditionally been described as mostly tone responsive and the lateral belt area of primates as mostly noise responsive. The present study was designed to unify the study of these two cortical areas using random spectrum stimuli (RSS), a new class of parametric, wideband, stationary acoustic stimuli. We found that 60\% of all neurons encountered in A1 and the lateral belt of awake marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) showed significant changes in firing rates in response to RSS. Of these, 89\% showed sustained spiking in response to one or more individual RSS, a substantially greater percentage than would be expected from traditional studies, indicating that RSS are well suited for studying these two cortical areas. When firing rates elicited by RSS were used to construct linear estimates of frequency tuning for these sustained responders, the shape of the estimate function remained relatively constant throughout the stimulus interval and across the stimulus properties of mean sound level, spectral density, and spectral contrast. This finding indicates that frequency tuning computed from RSS reflects a robust estimate of the actual tuning of a neuron. Use of this estimate to predict rate responses to other RSS, however, yielded poor results, implying that auditory cortex neurons integrate information across frequency nonlinearly. No systematic difference in prediction quality between A1 and the lateral belt could be detected.},

abstract = {To aid prospective neural connectivity inference analysts and hoping to preclude misconception spread, we exploit the didatic value of some of the issues raised by Albo et al. (Biol Cybern 90: 318-326, 2004) who claim that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values can lead to mistakes in structural inference when using partial coherence in connection to Gersch's 1970 method for spotting signal sources (Gersch in Math Biosci 14: 177- 196, 1972). We show theoretically that Gersch's method is able only to spot which measurement of some common underlying factor has the least amount of additive noise and that this has nothing to do with any reasonable notion of 'causality' as suggested by Albo et al. (Biol Cybern 90: 318-326, 2004). We also show that despite the inherent structural ambiguity of the model used by Albo et al. (Biol Cybern 90: 318-326, 2004) to back their claim, its data can nonetheless furnish the correct time precedence hierarchy between the activities in its measured structures, both when simple (correlation) and more sophisticated methods are used (partial directed coherence) (Baccala and Sameshima in Biol Cybern 84:463-474, 2001a) in a true depiction of time series causality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy has become a
standard treatment of locally advanced rectal adenocarcinomas (LARA).
It can reduce tumor volume, thus increases a feasibility of sphincter-sparing
surgery, shows less acute toxicity, improves local control rate.
It is based on fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine) with
concurrent radiotherapy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
capability of gene expression method to identify nonresponders (NR)
pretherapeutically. METHODS AND RESULTS: 17 patients with LARA, clinical
stage II, III according to IUCC were enrolled into our pilot study.
Response to therapy was determined clinically by transrectal ultrasonography
and CT/MRI before and after therapy and histopathologically by TRG
(tumor regression grade) according to Mandard. Patients with TRG
1-2 were included to responders group (R) and patients with TRG 4-5
composed NR group. Gene expression levels of 440 genes were obtained
by low-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Gene expression data
analysis based on SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) and
t-test methods identified 8 genes (RB1, RBBP4, HYOUI, JUNB, MDM4,
CANX, MMP2, TCF7L2) significantly upregulated in NR. CONCLUSIONS:
Validation of identified changes on the mRNA level (Real-Time PCR)
and on protein level (immunohistochemistry) is ongoing. We suggest
that low-density oligonucleotide microarray technology could contribute
to individualize the therapy of patients with LARA.},

abstract = {Abstract Dirichlet mixture priors provide a Bayesian formalism for scoring alignments of protein profiles to individual sequences, which can be generalized to constructing scores for multiple-alignment columns. A Dirichlet mixture is a probability distribution over multinomial space, each of whose components can be thought of as modeling a type of protein position. Applied to the simplest case of pairwise sequence alignment, a Dirichlet mixture is equivalent to an implied symmetric substitution matrix. For alphabets of even size L, Dirichlet mixtures with L/2 components and symmetric substitution matrices have an identical number of free parameters. Although this suggests the possibility of a one-to-one mapping between the two formalisms, we show that there are some symmetric matrices no Dirichlet mixture can imply, and others implied by many distinct Dirichlet mixtures. Dirichlet mixtures are derived empirically from curated sets of multiple alignments. They imply "background" amino acid frequencies characteristic of these sets, and should thus be non-optimal for comparing proteins with non-standard composition. Given a mixture $\Theta$, we seek an adjusted $\Theta$' that implies the desired composition, but that minimizes an appropriate relative-entropy-based distance function. To render the problem tractable, we fix the mixture parameter as well as the sum of the Dirichlet parameters for each component, allowing only its center of mass to vary. This linearizes the constraints on the remaining parameters. An approach to finding $\Theta$' may be based on small consecutive parameter adjustments. The relative entropy of two Dirichlet distributions separated by a small change in their parameter values implies a quadratic cost function for such changes. For a small change in implied background frequencies, this function can be minimized using the Lagrange-Newton method. We have implemented this method, and can compositionally adjust to good precision a 20-component Dirichlet mixture prior for proteins in under half a second on a standard workstation.},

The bacterial factor responsible for the enhanced drug release was identified as a previously unrecognized protein termed liposomase.

abstract = {Standard particle filtering technique have previously been applied to the problem of fiber tracking by Brun et al. [Brun, A., Bjornemo, M., Kikinis, R., Westin, C.F., 2002. White matter tractography using sequential importance sampling. In: Proceedings of the ISMRM Annual Meeting, p. 1131] and Bjornemo et al. [Bjornemo, M., Brun, A., Kikinis, R., Westin, C.F., 2002. Regularized stochastic white matter tractography using diffusion tensor MRI, In: Proc. MICCAI, pp. 435-442]. However, these previous attempts have not utilised the full power of the technique, and as a result the fiber paths were tracked in a goal directed way. In this paper, we provide an advanced technique by presenting a fast and novel probabilistic method for white matter fiber tracking in diffusion weighted MRI (DWI), which takes advantage of the weighting and resampling mechanism of particle filtering. We formulate fiber tracking using a non-linear state space model which captures both smoothness regularity of the fibers and the uncertainties in the local fiber orientations due to noise and partial volume effects. Global fiber tracking is then posed as a problem of particle filtering. To model the posterior distribution, we classify voxels of the white matter as either prolate or oblate tensors. We then construct the orientation distributions for prolate and oblate tensors separately. Finally, the importance density function for particle filtering is modeled using the von Mises-Fisher distribution on a unit sphere. Fast and efficient sampling is achieved using Ulrich-Wood's simulation algorithm. Given a seed point, the method is able to rapidly locate the globally optimal fiber and also provides a probability map for potential connections. The proposed method is validated and compared to alternative methods both on synthetic data and real-world brain MRI datasets.},

The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations
of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when
the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose

abstract = {Spectral methods are of fundamental importance in statistics and machine learning, because they underlie algorithms from classical principal components analysis to more recent approaches that exploit manifold structure. In most cases, the core technical problem can be reduced to computing a low-rank approximation to a positive-definite kernel. For the growing number of applications dealing with very large or high-dimensional datasets, however, the optimal approximation afforded by an exact spectral decomposition is too costly, because its complexity scales as the cube of either the number of training examples or their dimensionality. Motivated by such applications, we present here 2 new algorithms for the approximation of positive-semidefinite kernels, together with error bounds that improve on results in the literature. We approach this problem by seeking to determine, in an efficient manner, the most informative subset of our data relative to the kernel approximation task at hand. This leads to two new strategies based on the Nystr\"{o}m method that are directly applicable to massive datasets. The first of these-based on sampling-leads to a randomized algorithm whereupon the kernel induces a probability distribution on its set of partitions, whereas the latter approach-based on sorting-provides for the selection of a partition in a deterministic way. We detail their numerical implementation and provide simulation results for a variety of representative problems in statistical data analysis, each of which demonstrates the improved performance of our approach relative to existing methods.},

abstract = {Biophysically accurate multicompartmental models of individual neurons have significantly advanced our understanding of the input-output function of single cells. These models depend on a large number of parameters that are difficult to estimate. In practice, they are often hand-tuned to match measured physiological behaviors, thus raising questions of identifiability and interpretability. We propose a statistical approach to the automatic estimation of various biologically relevant parameters, including 1) the distribution of channel densities, 2) the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input, and 3) axial resistances across extended dendrites. Recent experimental advances, notably in voltage-sensitive imaging, motivate us to assume access to: i) the spatiotemporal voltage signal in the dendrite and ii) an approximate description of the channel kinetics of interest. We show here that, given i and ii, parameters 1-3 can be inferred simultaneously by nonnegative linear regression; that this optimization problem possesses a unique solution and is guaranteed to converge despite the large number of parameters and their complex nonlinear interaction; and that standard optimization algorithms efficiently reach this optimum with modest computational and data requirements. We demonstrate that the method leads to accurate estimations on a wide variety of challenging model data sets that include up to about 10(4) parameters (roughly two orders of magnitude more than previously feasible) and describe how the method gives insights into the functional interaction of groups of channels.},

abstract = {Spatial working memory or short-term place memory is impaired in schizophrenia.
The efficiency of antipsychotic drugs, particularly of typical antipsychotics,
on cognitive deficit in schizophrenia remains disputable. Inhibition
of serotonin (5-HT) 2A/2C receptors is important for cognitive improvement
in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics. The aim of
the present work was to establish the effect of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor
antagonist ritanserin (2.5 or 5 mg/kg), the dopamine D2 antagonist
haloperidol (0.1 or 1 mg/kg), and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone
(0.1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg), which is an antagonist of both 5-HT2A/2C
and D2 receptors, on cognitive deficit induced by subchronic administration
of dizocilpine (MK-801, 0.1 mg/kg). We used the active allothetic
place avoidance (AAPA) task, requiring the rat to differentiate between
relevant and irrelevant stimuli, in a way similar to disruption of
information processing disturbed in schizophrenic patients. Our results
show that treatment with 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonists, regardless
of their effect on D2 receptors, blocked the cognitive impairment
produced by MK-801. Haloperidol did not sufficiently reduce the deficit
in AAPA induced by MK-801. Interestingly, administration of risperidone
and haloperidol alone, but not ritanserin, impaired the AAPA performance
in intact rats. Ritanserin and risperidone actually improve cognition
independently of their effect on locomotor activity in an animal
model of schizophrenia-like behavior. This finding is in accordance
with the assumption that some antipsychotics are primarily effective
against cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

We asked whether this assumption holds true if the moving stimulus consists of a second-order motion stimulus. In addition, we asked whether neurons in area MT and MST code for moving sound sources. To answer these questions, we trained three rhesus monkeys on a direction-discrimination task. Our monkeys were able to correctly report the direction of all motion stimuli used in this study. Firing rates of directionally selective neurons from area MT (n = 38) and MST (n = 68) were recorded during task performance. These neurons coded only for the stimulus movement if the motion stimulus was separated from the background by luminance or flicker (Fourier and drift-balanced motion). If these segregation cues were absent (in the case of theta motion and of the moving sound source), firing rates did not code for the stimulus' direction. Therefore we conclude that although areas MT and MST are undoubtedly involved in processing a moving stimulus, they are not the final cortical stages responsible for perceiving it.},

Recently, state-space approaches were developed to combine goal planning and trajectory-guiding neural activity in the control of reaching movements of an assistive device to static goals. In this paper, we extend these algorithms to allow for goals that may change over the course of the reach. Performance between static and dynamic goal state equations and a standard free movement state equation is compared in simulation. Simulated trials are also used to explore the possibility of incorporating activity from parietal areas that have previously been associated with dynamic goal position. Performance is quantified using mean-square error (MSE) of trajectory estimates. We also demonstrate the use of goal estimate MSE in evaluating algorithms for the control of goal-directed movements. Finally, we propose a framework to combine sensor data and control algorithms along with neural activity and state equations, to coordinate goal-directed movements through brain-driven interfaces.},

of non-interacting particles in large networks consisting of M d-dimensional
containers C1, . . . ,CM with radii Ri linked together by tubes of
length lij and radii aij where i, j = 1, 2, . . .M. Tubes may join
directly with each other forming junctions. It is possible that some
links are absent. Instead of solving the diffusion equation for the
full problem we formulated an approach that is computationally more
efficient. We derived a set of rate equations that govern the time
dependence of the number of particles in each container N1(t),N2(t),
. . . ,NM(t). In such a way the complicated transport problem is
reduced to a set of M first order integro-differential equations
in time, which can be solved efficiently by the algorithm presented
here. The rate equations are valid for any network topology under
the assumption that the tubes are thin in comparison to their lengths
and the radii of the containers, aij \^{a}‰ª Ri,Rj , lij . Under these
assumptions the containers can be considered ideally mixed at all
times and transport through the tubes is one-dimensional. These assumptions
were verified numerically. The workings of the method have been demonstrated
on a couple of examples: networks involving three, four and seven
containers, and one network with a three-point junction. Already
simple networks with relatively few containers exhibit interesting
transport behavior. For example, we showed that it is possible to
adjust the geometry of the networks so that the particle concentration
varies in time in a wave-like manner. Such behavior deviates from
simple exponential growth and decay occurring in the two container
system. In addition, we showed how to eliminate junctions from the
dynamical equations in the large time limit.},

mixing is equivalent to multiplicative mixing of complex signal sources

signals into independent components by a complex infomax ICA algorithm.
First results from a visual attention EEG experiment exhibit: (1)
sources of spatio-temporal dynamics in the data, (2) links to subject

Single cell response patterns were examined using peri-stimulus (PST) histograms and functional connectivity among neighboring cells by the cross renewal density (CRD) histograms. Analysis of the PST histograms suggested that a high percentage of single cells demonstrated different response patterns to different stimuli. Analysis of the CRD histograms suggested, on the one hand, that only small numbers of neighboring cells behaved as if there were direct connections from one cell to another, and that these direct connections appeared to be excitatory. On the other hand, many cell pairs shared input from shared sources which lay outside the local groups. The majority of functional connections were altered by at least one of the stimuli delivered, thus demonstrating the system's plasticity.

abstract = {The interaction between the excitatory climbing fiber (CF) response

and stellate cell inhibition was studied in guinea pig Purkinje cells

in sagittal slices from the cerebellar vermis. Sharp microelectrode

recordings from the soma or dendrites were combined with high-speed

fluorescence imaging of intracellularly injected fura-2. In this

way both the electrical responses and the associated [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i

changes could be monitored at the same time. Usually simultaneously

activated inhibition caused almost no change to the somatically recorded

CF response. However, the inhibition caused a strong reduction in

the CF-associated [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i increase which normally was widespread

in the dendrites. This effect was graded; stronger inhibition caused

a larger and more widespread reduction in the [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i change

that was greatest in the more distal dendrites. Sometimes the reduction

was over 90\% in the distal dendrites and occasionally it was localized

to only a single dendritic branch. Both the inhibitory postsynaptic

potential (IPSP) and the associated reduction in the CF-induced [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i

change were blocked by bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist.

Dendritic recordings showed that each CF response evoked a 2-3 msec

wide action potential. The amplitude of this action potential was

reduced in a graded manner by the IPSP in parallel with the reduction

in the [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i change. Varying the time between the activation

of the IPSP and the CF response showed that both the reduction in

the [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i change and the action potential amplitude occurred

in a narrow time window of about 8-10 msec, about the rise time of

the IPSP. Together these results indicate that the CF response activates

a fast dendritic \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} spike that causes most of the [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i

increase, both of which can be blocked by an inhibitory shunting

conductance. This interaction provides a means whereby \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}-dependent

dendritic mechanisms can be modulated without affecting the immediate

output of the Purkinje cell.},

abstract = {Neocortical interneurons display great morphological and physiological variability and are ideally positioned to control circuit dynamics, although their exact role is still poorly understood. To better understand this diversity, we have performed a detailed anatomical and physiological characterization of 3 subtypes of visual cortex interneurons, isolated from transgenic mice which express green fluorescent protein in somatostatin, parvalbumin, and neuropeptide Y positive neurons. We find that these 3 groups of interneurons have systematic differences in dendritic and axonal morphologies and also characteristically differ in the frequencies, amplitude, and kinetics of the spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents they receive. Moreover, we detect a correlation between the kinetics of their synaptic inputs and quantitative aspects of their axonal arborizations. This suggests that different interneuron types could channel different temporal patterns of activity. Our results also confirm the importance of the axonal morphology to classify interneurons.},

abstract = {Complex, non-additive genetic interactions are common and can be critical in determining phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and similar statistical studies of linkage data, however, assume additive models of gene interactions in looking for genotype-phenotype associations. These statistical methods view the compound effects of multiple genes on a phenotype as a sum of influences of each gene and often miss a substantial part of the heritable effect. Such methods do not use any biological knowledge about underlying mechanisms. Modeling approaches from the artificial intelligence (AI) field that incorporate deterministic knowledge into models to perform statistical analysis can be applied to include prior knowledge in genetic analysis. We chose to use the most general such approach, Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), for combining deterministic knowledge with statistical analysis. Using simple, logistic regression-type MLNs we can replicate the results of traditional statistical methods, but we also show that we are able to go beyond finding independent markers linked to a phenotype by using joint inference without an independence assumption. The method is applied to genetic data on yeast sporulation, a complex phenotype with gene interactions. In addition to detecting all of the previously identified loci associated with sporulation, our method identifies four loci with smaller effects. Since their effect on sporulation is small, these four loci were not detected with methods that do not account for dependence between markers due to gene interactions. We show how gene interactions can be detected using more complex models, which can be used as a general framework for incorporating systems biology with genetics.},

abstract = {Spatially two-dimensional nonequilibrium mathematical model describing
electroosmotic flow through a submicrometer channel with an electric
charge fixed on the channel walls is presented. This system is governed
by the hydrodynamic, electrostatic, and mass transport phenomena.
The model is based on the coupled mass balances, Poisson, Navier-Stokes,
and Nernst-Planck equations. Nonslip boundary conditions are employed.
The effect of an imposed electric field on the system behavior is
studied by means of a numerical analysis of the model equations.
We have obtained the following findings. If the channel width is
comparable to the thickness of the electric double layer, the system
behaves as an ion-exchange membrane and the dependence of the electric
current passing through the channel on the applied voltage is strongly
nonlinear. In the case of negatively (positively) charged walls,
a narrow region of very low conductivity (so-called ionic gate) is
formed in the free electrolyte near the channel entry facing the
anode (cathode) side. For a wide channel, the electric current is
proportional to the applied voltage and the velocity of electrokinetic
flow is linearly proportional to the electric field strength. Complex
hydrodynamics (eddy formation and existence of ionic gates) is the
most interesting characteristics of the studied system. Hence, current-voltage
and velocity-voltage curves and the corresponding spatial distributions
of the model variables at selected points are studied and described

abstract = {Methods for generating a random sample of networks with desired properties are important tools for the analysis of social, biological, and information networks. Algorithm-based approaches to sampling networks have received a great deal of attention in recent literature. Most of these algorithms are based on simple intuitions that associate the full features of connectivity patterns with specific values of only one or two network metrics. Substantive conclusions are crucially dependent on this association holding true. However, the extent to which this simple intuition holds true is not yet known. In this paper, we examine the association between the connectivity patterns that a network sampling algorithm aims to generate and the connectivity patterns of the generated networks, measured by an existing set of popular network metrics. We find that different network sampling algorithms can yield networks with similar connectivity patterns. We also find that the alternative algorithms for the same connectivity pattern can yield networks with different connectivity patterns. We argue that conclusions based on simulated network studies must focus on the full features of the connectivity patterns of a network instead of on the limited set of network metrics for a specific network type. This fact has important implications for network data analysis: for instance, implications related to the way significance is currently assessed.},

abstract = {Polygon/spline approximation of arbitrary image region shapes is submitted
for tool evaluation. First, polygon approximation is performed. Starting
with an initial 4\^{A}–vertices polygon which represents the farest elongations

refined taking into account the local requirements until a given
tolerance criterion is satisfied everywhere. Then, spline approximation
is calculated using the polygon vertices. Whenever spline approximation
also satisfies the tolerance criterion for a certain part of the
shape, spline approximation substitutes polygon approximation for
that part thus giving the approximated shape a more natural look.
By this combined approach, the advantages of both techniques are
utilized and their disadvantages avoided. Thus, the combined approach
is efficient in terms of reduction of the number of shape points
for which coordinates must be transmitted and with this also in terms
of bit rate reduction. It has no interdependency during the iterative
refinement of the approximation in different parts of the shape,
and it has a natural look. Predictive coding is proposed for further
bit rate reduction.},

abstract = {The functional brain networks, extracted from fMRI images using independent component analysis, have been demonstrated informative for distinguishing brain states of cognitive function and brain disorders. Rather than analyzing each network encoded by a spatial independent component separately, we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis of functional brain networks jointly at an individual level. The functional brain networks of each individual are used as bases for a linear subspace, referred to as a functional connectivity pattern, which facilitates a comprehensive characterization of fMRI data. The functional connectivity patterns of different individuals are analyzed on the Grassmann manifold by adopting a principal angle based Riemannian distance. In conjunction with a support vector machine classifier, a forward component selection technique is proposed to select independent components for constructing the most discriminative functional connectivity pattern. The discriminant analysis method has been applied to an fMRI based schizophrenia study with 31 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy individuals. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves a promising classification performance for distinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy controls, but also identifies discriminative functional brain networks that are informative for schizophrenia diagnosis.},

The prevailing view has been that information processing in neural networks results primarily from the properties of synapses and the connectivity of neurons within the network, with the intrinsic excitability of single neurons playing a lesser role. As a consequence, the contribution of single neurons to computation in the brain has long been underestimated. Here we review recent work showing that neuronal dendrites exhibit a range of linear and nonlinear mechanisms that allow them to implement elementary computations. We discuss why these dendritic properties may be essential for the computations performed by the neuron and the network and provide theoretical and experimental examples to support this view.},

applying a process of recursive coarsening in which the same minimization

additional internal statistics of the emerging segments and use these
statistics to facilitate the segmentation process. Once the pyramid

abstract = {The function of the cerebral cortex is dependent on the precise organization of the circuits formed by its component neurons. The connections between neurons are not random, but are specific at multiple levels of organization. For example, each cortical area connects to only a selected subset of other areas and within any given area the axonal and dendritic arbors of individual neurons arborize in precise, layer-specific patterns (for review see Felleman \& Van Essen, 1991; Callaway, 1998). In each layer there are dendrites from multiple cell types including cells with somata both within and outside that layer. Anatomical studies have shown that axons arborizing in a particular cortical layer can connect selectively onto dendrites of some cell types in the layer, while avoiding the dendrites of other cell types (e.g. Freund \& Gulyas, 1991; Hornung \& Celio, 1992; Staiger et al., 1996). These cell type specific connections are, however, difficult to elucidate with anatomical methods, so the frequency of such specificity has remained elusive. Recent experimental methods combining intracellular recording of single neurons with focal neuronal stimulation by uncaging glutamate with light ("photostimulation") have made the analysis of cell type specific cortical connections more tractable. These studies show that cell type specificity of connections is prevalent in cortex. Here I review photostimulation-based studies investigating the laminar sources of cortical input to distinct cell types in the visual and somatosensory cortices of rats and the primary visual cortex of monkeys.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal behavior is governed by the activity of interconnected brain circuits. Comprehensive brain wiring maps are thus needed in order to formulate hypotheses about information flow and also to guide genetic manipulations aimed at understanding how genes and circuits orchestrate complex behaviors. RESULTS: To assemble this map, we deconstructed the adult Drosophila brain into approximately 16,000 single neurons and reconstructed them into a common standardized framework to produce a virtual fly brain. We have constructed a mesoscopic map and found that it consists of 41 local processing units (LPUs), six hubs, and 58 tracts covering the whole Drosophila brain. Despite individual local variation, the architecture of the Drosophila brain shows invariance for both the aggregation of local neurons (LNs) within specific LPUs and for the connectivity of projection neurons (PNs) between the same set of LPUs. An open-access image database, named FlyCircuit, has been constructed for online data archiving, mining, analysis, and three-dimensional visualization of all single neurons, brain-wide LPUs, their wiring diagrams, and neural tracts. CONCLUSION: We found that the Drosophila brain is assembled from families of multiple LPUs and their interconnections. This provides an essential first step in the analysis of information processing within and between neurons in a complete brain.},

abstract = {The prediction that black holes radiate due to quantum effects is
often considered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in
curved space\^{A}–time. Yet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions:
that ordinary physics may be applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy
scales increasing exponentially without bound; and that quantum\^{A}–gravitational
effects may be neglected. Various suggestions have been put forward
to address these issues: that they might be explained away by lessons
from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is indeed successfully
reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link provided
by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies
the prediction. This paper explains the nature of the difficulties,
and reviews the proposals that have been put forward to deal with
them. None of the proposals put forward can so far be considered
to be really successful, and simple dimensional arguments show that
quantum\^{A}–gravitational effects might well alter the evaporation process
outlined by Hawking. Thus a definitive theoretical treatment will
require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some regimes.
Until then, no compelling theoretical case for or against radiation
by black holes is likely to be made. The possibility that non\^{A}–radiating
\"{\i}¾“mini\"{\i}¾” black holes exist should be taken seriously; such holes
could be part of the dark matter in the Universe. Attempts to place
observational limits on the number of \"{\i}¾“mini\"{\i}¾” black holes (independent
of the assumption that they radiate) would be most welcome.},

abstract = {This paper presents MicroTrack, an algorithm that combines global tractography and direct microstructure estimation using diffusion-weighted imaging data. Previous work recovers connectivity via tractography independently from estimating microstructure features, such as axon diameter distribution and density. However, the two estimates have great potential to inform one another given the common assumption that microstructural features remain consistent along fibers. Here we provide a preliminary examination of this hypothesis. We adapt a global tractography algorithm to associate axon diameter with each putative pathway and optimize both the set of pathways and their microstructural parameters to find the best fit of this holistic white-matter model to the MRI data. We demonstrate in simulation that, with a multi-shell HARDI acquisition, this approach not only improves estimates of microstructural parameters over voxel-by-voxel estimation, but provides a solution to long standing problems in tractography. In particular, a simple experiment demonstrates the resolution of the well known ambiguity between crossing and kissing fibers. The results strongly motivate further development of this kind of algorithm for brain connectivity mapping.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Normal aging involves a decline in cognitive function that
has been shown to correlate with volumetric change in the hippocampus,
and with genetic variability in the APOE-gene. In the present study
we utilize 3D MR imaging, genetic analysis and assessment of verbal
memory function to investigate relationships between these factors
in a sample of 170 healthy volunteers (age range 46-77 years).METHODS:Brain
morphometric analysis was performed with the automated segmentation
work-flow implemented in FreeSurfer. Genetic analysis of the APOE
genotype was determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA
from whole-blood. All individuals were subjected to extensive neuropsychological
testing, including the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT).
To obtain robust and easily interpretable relationships between explanatory
variables and verbal memory function we applied the recent method
of conditional inference trees in addition to scatterplot matrices
and simple pairwise linear least-squares regression analysis.RESULTS:APOE
genotype had no significant impact on the CVLT results (scores on
long delay free recall, CVLT-LD) or the ICV-normalized hippocampal
volumes. Hippocampal volumes were found to decrease with age and
a right-larger-than-left hippocampal asymmetry was also found. These
findings are in accordance with previous studies. CVLT-LD score was
shown to correlate with hippocampal volume. Multivariate conditional
inference analysis showed that gender and left hippocampal volume
largely dominated predictive values for CVLT-LD scores in our sample.
Left hippocampal volume dominated predictive values for females but
not for males. APOE genotype did not alter the model significantly,
and age was only partly influencing the results.CONCLUSION:Gender
and left hippocampal volumes are main predictors for verbal memory
function in normal aging. APOE genotype did not affect the results
in any part of our analysis.},

abstract = {Excitatory cortical neurons form fine-scale networks of precisely interconnected neurons. Here we tested whether inhibitory cortical neurons in rat visual cortex might also be connected with fine-scale specificity. Using paired intracellular recordings and cross-correlation analyses of photostimulation-evoked synaptic currents, we found that fast-spiking interneurons preferentially connected to neighboring pyramids that provided them with reciprocal excitation. Furthermore, they shared common fine-scale excitatory input with neighboring pyramidal neurons only when the two cells were reciprocally connected, and not when there was no connection or a one-way, inhibitory-to-excitatory connection. Adapting inhibitory neurons shared little or no common input with neighboring pyramids, regardless of their direct connectivity. We conclude that inhibitory connections and also excitatory connections to inhibitory neurons can both be precise on a fine scale. Furthermore, fine-scale specificity depends on the type of inhibitory neuron and on direct connectivity between neighboring pyramidal-inhibitory neuron pairs.},

abstract = {The complex organization of connectivity in the human brain is incompletely understood. Recently, topological measures based on graph theory have provided a new approach to quantify large-scale cortical networks. These methods have been applied to anatomical connectivity data on nonhuman species, and cortical networks have been shown to have small-world topology, associated with high local and global efficiency of information transfer. Anatomical networks derived from cortical thickness measurements have shown the same organizational properties of the healthy human brain, consistent with similar results reported in functional networks derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalographic data. Here we show, using anatomical networks derived from analysis of inter-regional covariation of gray matter volume in MRI data on 259 healthy volunteers, that classical divisions of cortex (multimodal, unimodal, and transmodal) have some distinct topological attributes. Although all cortical divisions shared nonrandom properties of small-worldness and efficient wiring (short mean Euclidean distance between connected regions), the multimodal network had a hierarchical organization, dominated by frontal hubs with low clustering, whereas the transmodal network was assortative. Moreover, in a sample of 203 people with schizophrenia, multimodal network organization was abnormal, as indicated by reduced hierarchy, the loss of frontal and the emergence of nonfrontal hubs, and increased connection distance. We propose that the topological differences between divisions of normal cortex may represent the outcome of different growth processes for multimodal and transmodal networks and that neurodevelopmental abnormalities in schizophrenia specifically impact multimodal cortical organization.},

abstract = {Multi-neuronal recording is a powerful electrophysiological technique that has revealed much of what is known about the neuronal interactions in the brain. However, it is difficult to detect precise spike timings, especially synchronized simultaneous firings, among closely neighboring neurons recorded by one common electrode because spike waveforms overlap on the electrode when two or more neurons fire simultaneously. In addition, the non-Gaussian variability (nonstationarity) of spike waveforms, typically seen in the presence of so-called complex spikes, limits the ability to sort multi-neuronal activities into their single-neuron components. Because of these problems, the ordinary spike-sorting techniques often give inaccurate results. Our previous study has shown that independent component analysis (ICA) can solve these problems and separate single-neuron components from multi-neuronal recordings. The ICA has, however, one serious limitation that the number of separated neurons must be less than the number of electrodes. The present study combines the ICA and the efficiency of the ordinary spike-sorting technique (k-means clustering) to solve the spike-overlapping and the nonstationarity problems with no limitation on the number of single neurons to be separated. First, multi-neuronal activities are sorted into an overly large number of clusters by k-means clustering. Second, the sorted clusters are decomposed by ICA. Third, the decomposed clusters are progressively aggregated into a minimal set of putative single neurons based on similarities of basis vectors estimated by ICA. We applied the present procedure to multi-neuronal waveforms recorded with tetrodes composed of four microwires in the prefrontal cortex of awake behaving monkeys. The results demonstrate that there are functional connections among neighboring pyramidal neurons, some of which fire in a precise simultaneous manner and that precisely time-locked monosynaptic connections are working between neighboring pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Detection of these phenomena suggests that the present procedure can sort multi-neuronal activities, which include overlapping spikes and realistic non-Gaussian variability of spike waveforms, into their single-neuron components. We processed several types of synthesized data sets in this procedure and confirmed that the procedure was highly reliable and stable. The present method provides insights into the local circuit bases of excitatory and inhibitory interactions among neighboring neurons.},

abstract = {Spatial patterns of cellular growth generate mechanical stresses that help to push, fold, expand, and deform tissues into their specific forms. Genetic factors are thought to specify patterns of growth and other behaviors to drive morphogenesis. Here, we show that tissue form itself can feed back to regulate patterns of proliferation. Using micro-fabrication to control the organization of sheets of cells, we demonstrated the emergence of stable patterns of proliferative foci. Regions of concentrated growth corresponded to regions of high tractional stress generated within the sheet, as predicted by a finite-element model of multicellular mechanics and measured directly by using a micromechanical force sensor array. Inhibiting actomyosin-based tension or cadherin-mediated connections between cells disrupted the spatial pattern of proliferation. These findings demonstrate the existence of patterns of mechanical forces that originate from the contraction of cells, emerge from their multicellular organization, and result in patterns of growth. Thus, tissue form is not only a consequence but also an active regulator of tissue growth.},

to a brief translation of one of two superimposed surfaces, observers
reliably report the direction of that translation as well as the
direction of a second translation of the cued surface. In contrast,
if the uncued surface translates second, direction judgments are
severely impaired for several hundred milliseconds. We replicated
this result, but found that the impairment survived the removal of
the endogenous cue. The impairment is therefore not due to endogenously
cued attention. Instead, a brief translation of one surface acts
as an exogenous cue that triggers an automatic selection mechanism,
which suppresses processing of the other surface. This study provides
a clear case of exogenous cueing of surface-based attention. We relate
these results to identified competitive selection mechanisms in visual
cortex.},

Fitting structural equation models (SEM) from quantitative genetics, we evaluated genetic influences on the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), a novel measure of fiber spatial coherence, and on the generalized fiber anisotropy (GFA) a measure of fiber integrity. With random-effects regression, we mapped regions where diffusion profiles were highly correlated with subjects' intelligence quotient (IQ). Fiber complexity was predominantly under genetic control, and higher in more highly anisotropic regions; the proportion of genetic versus environmental control varied spatially. Our methods show promise for discovering genes affecting fiber connectivity in the brain.},

For predictor spaces featuring complex dependency patterns between the involved variables, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data tends to be very small due to the high redundancy induced by the dependencies. In situations of this type, it is useful to approximate the high-dimensional predictor space through a low-dimensional manifold (i.e., a curve or a surface), and use the projections onto the manifold as compressed predictors in the regression problem. In the case that the intrinsic dimensionality of the predictor space equals one, we use the local principal curve algorithm for the the compression step. We provide a novel algorithm which extends this idea to local principal surfaces, thus covering cases of an intrinsic dimensionality equal to two, which is in principle extendible to manifolds of arbitrary dimension. We motivate and apply the novel techniques using astrophysical and oceanographic data examples.},

arduous task because of noisy or incomplete data. However, handsegmented
data are often available and most of the structures to be extracted

of modeling a family of shapes and restricting the new structure
to be extracted within this class is of particular interest. This
approach is commonly implemented using active shape models [2] and
the definition of the image term is the most challenging component
of such an approach. In parallel, level set methods [8] define a
powerful optimization framework, that can be used to recover objects
of interest by the propagation of curves or surfaces. They can support
complex topologies, considered in higher dimensions, are implicit,
intrinsic and parameter free. In this paper we re-visit active shape
models and introduce a level set variant of them. Such an approach
can account for prior shape knowledge quite efficiently as well as
use data/image terms of various form and complexity. Promising results

This approach provides a clear set of guidelines for combining experimental data with other knowledge about sensory function to obtain a description that optimally predicts the way that neurons process sensory information. This prediction paradigm provides an objective method for evaluating and comparing computational models. In this chapter we review many of the system identification algorithms that have been used in sensory neurophysiology, and we show how they can be viewed as variants of a single statistical inference problem. We then review many of the practical issues that arise when applying these methods to neurophysiological experiments: stimulus selection, behavioral control, model visualization, and validation. Finally we discuss several problems to which system identification has been applied recently, including one important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience: developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.},

In this study, we performed extensive analyses to test the hypothesis that individual differences in intelligence are associated with brain structural organization, and in particular that higher scores on intelligence tests are related to greater global efficiency of the brain anatomical network. We constructed binary and weighted brain anatomical networks in each of 79 healthy young adults utilizing diffusion tensor tractography and calculated topological properties of the networks using a graph theoretical method. Based on their IQ test scores, all subjects were divided into general and high intelligence groups and significantly higher global efficiencies were found in the networks of the latter group. Moreover, we showed significant correlations between IQ scores and network properties across all subjects while controlling for age and gender. Specifically, higher intelligence scores corresponded to a shorter characteristic path length and a higher global efficiency of the networks, indicating a more efficient parallel information transfer in the brain. The results were consistently observed not only in the binary but also in the weighted networks, which together provide convergent evidence for our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of brain structural organization may be an important biological basis for intelligence.},

abstract = {One of the major lessons of memory research has been that human memory is fallible, imprecise, and subject to interference. Thus, although observers can remember thousands of images, it is widely assumed that these memories lack detail. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image. Participants viewed pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 h. Afterward, they were shown pairs of images and indicated which of the two they had seen. The previously viewed item could be paired with either an object from a novel category, an object of the same basic-level category, or the same object in a different state or pose. Performance in each of these conditions was remarkably high (92\%, 88\%, and 87\%, respectively), suggesting that participants successfully maintained detailed representations of thousands of images. These results have implications for cognitive models, in which capacity limitations impose a primary computational constraint (e.g., models of object recognition), and pose a challenge to neural models of memory storage and retrieval, which must be able to account for such a large and detailed storage capacity.},

to detect pteridins such as neopterin and biopterin. The fluorescence
detection was evaluated in detail for neopterin, an immune response
and tumor marker. The urinary content of neopterin, assessed by using
the HPLC method, was verified with a commercial neopterin enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit as indicated by the high correlation
between the two methods (r=0.98). In urinary samples from 58 young
healthy individuals (male and female nonsmokers, ages 19-39 years),
it was found that there was no significant correlation (r=-0.04)
between the levels of 8-OH-dG and neopterin (as normalized to urinary
creatinine levels). In contrast, in urinary samples from 60 old healthy
individuals (male and female nonsmokers, ages 60-86 years), there
was a significant correlation (r=0.47) found between the levels of
8-OH-dG and neopterin (as normalized to urinary creatinine levels).
These findings strongly indicate that the higher level of immune
response that was correlating with old age contributes significantly
to the higher level of oxidative damage as assessed in the form of
8-OH-dG. Using this type of HPLC system, it is possible to evaluate
oxidative DNA damage and immune response simultaneously using the
respective urinary markers. These data may contribute to understanding
of the pathophysiology of diseases such as infections and tumor progression
where both oxidative stress and immune response occur simultaneously.},

abstract = {Establishing correspondences across brains for the purposes of comparison
and group analysis is almost universally done by registering images
to one another either directly or via a template. However, there
are many registration algorithms to choose from. A recent evaluation
of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain
image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present
study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate
of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods,
as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head
and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to
compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than
16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We
compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels,
registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following:
1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal
average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration;
and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface
labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison
between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods
using present resampling methods. From the results of this study,
we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample
drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using
the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template.},

@article{Fiala2001,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analysis of brain ultrastructure is needed to reveal how
neurons communicate with one another via synapses and how disease
processes alter this communication. In the past, such analyses have
usually been based on single or paired sections obtained by electron
microscopy. Reconstruction from multiple serial sections provides
a much needed, richer representation of the three-dimensional organization
of the brain. This paper introduces a new reconstruction system and
new methods for analyzing in three dimensions the location and ultrastructure
of neuronal components, such as synapses, which are distributed non-randomly
throughout the brain. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Volumes are reconstructed
by defining transformations that align the entire area of adjacent
sections. Whole-field alignment requires rotation, translation, skew,
scaling, and second-order nonlinear deformations. Such transformations
are implemented by a linear combination of bivariate polynomials.
Computer software for generating transformations based on user input
is described. Stereological techniques for assessing structural distributions
in reconstructed volumes are the unbiased bricking, disector, unbiased
ratio, and per-length counting techniques. A new general method,
the fractional counter, is also described. This unbiased technique
relies on the counting of fractions of objects contained in a test
volume. A volume of brain tissue from stratum radiatum of hippocampal
area CA1 is reconstructed and analyzed for synaptic density to demonstrate
and compare the techniques. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction
makes practicable volume-oriented analysis of ultrastructure using
such techniques as the unbiased bricking and fractional counter methods.
These analysis methods are less sensitive to the section-to-section
variations in counts and section thickness, factors that contribute
to the inaccuracy of other stereological methods. In addition, volume
reconstruction facilitates visualization and modeling of structures
and analysis of three-dimensional relationships such as synaptic
connectivity.},

abstract = {It is well known that many stimulus parameters, such as sound location in the auditory system or contrast in the visual system, can modulate the timing of the first spike in sensory neurons. Could first-spike latency be a candidate neural code? Most studies measuring first-spike latency information assume that the brain has an independent reference for stimulus onset from which to extract latency. This assumption creates an obvious confound that casts doubt on the feasibility of first-spike latency codes. If latency is measured relative to an internal reference of stimulus onset calculated from the responses of the neural population, the information conveyed by the latency of single neurons might decrease because of correlated changes in latency across the population. Here we assess the effects of a realistic model of stimulus onset detection on the first-spike latency information conveyed by single neurons in the auditory system. Contrary to expectation, we find that on average, the information contained in single neurons does not decrease; in fact, the majority of neurons show a slight increase in the information conveyed by latency referenced to a population onset. Our results show that first-spike latency codes are a feasible mechanism for information transfer even when biologically plausible estimates of stimulus onset are taken into account.},

Currently PPI networks for individuals are not available, but gene expression data is becoming easier to obtain and allows us to represent individuals by a co-integrated gene expression/protein interaction network. Two major problems hamper the application of graph kernels - state-of-the-art methods for whole-graph comparison - to compare PPI networks. First, these methods do not scale to graphs of the size of a PPI network. Second, missing edges in these interaction networks are biologically relevant for detecting discrepancies, yet, these methods do not take this into account. In this article we present graph kernels for biological network comparison that are fast to compute and take into account missing interactions. We evaluate their practical performance on two datasets of co-integrated gene expression/PPI networks.},

abstract = {We describe a method for determining intracellular free calcium concentration

([\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]) from single-wavelength fluorescence signals. In

contrast to previous single-wavelength calibration methods, the proposed

method does not require independent estimates of resting [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]

but relies on the measurement of fluorescence close to indicator

saturation during an experiment. Consequently, it is well suited

to [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}] indicators for which saturation can be achieved

under physiological conditions. In addition, the method requires

that the indicators have large dynamic ranges. Popular indicators

such as Calcium Green-1 or Fluo-3 fulfill these conditions. As a

test of the method, we measured [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}] in CA1 pyramidal neurons

in rat hippocampal slices using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 and 2-photon

laser scanning microscopy (BAPTA: 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',

N'-tetraacetic acid). Resting [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}] was 32-59 nM in the

proximal apical dendrite. Monitoring action potential-evoked [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]

transients as a function of indicator loading yielded estimates of

endogenous buffering capacity (44-80) and peak [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}] changes

at zero added buffer (178-312 nM). In young animals (postnatal days

14-17) our results were comparable to previous estimates obtained

by ratiometric methods (, Biophys. J. 70:1069-1081), and no significant

differences were seen in older animals (P24-28). We expect our method

to be widely applicable to measurements of [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}] and [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]-dependent

processes in small neuronal compartments, particularly in the many

situations that do not permit wavelength ratio imaging.},

The convex-concave programming formulation is obtained by rewriting the weighted graph matching problem as a least-square problem on the set of permutation matrices and relaxing it to two different optimization problems: a quadratic convex and a quadratic concave optimization problem on the set of doubly stochastic matrices. The concave relaxation has the same global minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its global minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We therefore construct an approximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a convex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and concave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows to easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the optimization problem, and therefore to perform labeled weighted graph matching. The algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching methods on four datasets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images and handwritten chinese characters. In all cases, the results are competitive with the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for estimating the probability mass function (pmf) of a discrete and finite random variable from a small sample. We focus on the observed counts--the number of times each value appears in the sample--and define the maximum likelihood set (MLS) as the set of pmfs that put more mass on the observed counts than on any other set of counts possible for the same sample size. We characterize the MLS in detail in this article. We show that the MLS is a diamond-shaped subset of the probability simplex [0,1]k bounded by at most k x (k-1) hyper-planes, where k is the number of possible values of the random variable. The MLS always contains the empirical distribution, as well as a family of Bayesian estimators based on a Dirichlet prior, particularly the well-known Laplace estimator. We propose to select from the MLS the pmf that is closest to a fixed pmf that encodes prior knowledge. When using Kullback-Leibler distance for this selection, the optimization problem comprises finding the minimum of a convex function over a domain defined by linear inequalities, for which standard numerical procedures are available. We apply this estimate to language modeling using Zipf's law to encode prior knowledge and show that this method permits obtaining state-of-the-art results while being conceptually simpler than most competing methods.},

A single action potential evoked a transient increase of intradendritic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that was reduced in size and prolonged when the Fura-2 concentration was increased from 20 to 250 microM. Extrapolation to zero Fura-2 concentration suggests that "physiological" transients at 37 degrees C have large amplitudes (150-300 nM) and fast decays (time constant < 100 ms). Assuming a homogeneous compartment model for the dendrite, 0.5-1\% of the total Ca2+ entering during an action potential was estimated to remain free. Washout of cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffers was not detectable, suggesting that they are relatively immobile. During trains of action potentials, [Ca2+]i increased and rapidly reached a steady state (time constant < 200 ms), fluctuating around a plateau level which depended linearly on the action potential frequency. Thus, the mean dendritic [Ca2+]i encodes the action potential frequency during physiological patterns of electrical activity and may regulate Ca(2+)-dependent dendritic functions in an activity-dependent way.},

abstract = {The spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) is a functional descriptor of the linear processing of time-varying acoustic spectra by the auditory system. By cross-correlating sustained neuronal activity with the dynamic spectrum of a spectrotemporally rich stimulus ensemble, one obtains an estimate of the STRF. In this article, the relationship between the spectrotemporal structure of any given stimulus and the quality of the STRF estimate is explored and exploited. Invoking the Fourier theorem, arbitrary dynamic spectra are described as sums of basic sinusoidal components--that is, moving ripples. Accurate estimation is found to be especially reliant on the prominence of components whose spectral and temporal characteristics are of relevance to the auditory locus under study and is sensitive to the phase relationships between components with identical temporal signatures. These and other observations have guided the development and use of stimuli with deterministic dynamic spectra composed of the superposition of many temporally orthogonal moving ripples having a restricted, relevant range of spectral scales and temporal rates. The method, termed sum-of-ripples, is similar in spirit to the white-noise approach but enjoys the same practical advantages--which equate to faster and more accurate estimation--attributable to the time-domain sum-of-sinusoids method previously employed in vision research. Application of the method is exemplified with both modeled data and experimental data from ferret primary auditory cortex (AI).},

abstract = {Genetically encoded probes show great promise in permitting functional imaging of specified neuronal populations in the intact nervous system, yet their in vivo application has been limited. Here, we have targeted expression of synapto-pHluorin, a pH-sensitive protein that reports synaptic vesicle fusion, to olfactory sensory neurons in mouse. Synapto-pHluorin selectively labeled presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons in glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Odorant stimulation evoked large-amplitude fluorescence increases that were localized to individual glomeruli in vivo, correlated with presynaptic calcium influx, graded with stimulus intensity, and stable over a period of days. Spatial patterns of odorant-activated glomeruli were distributed and did not change systematically with increasing carbon chain length, in contrast to the finely organized chemotopy that has been reported using other imaging methods. Targeted expression of synapto-pHluorin in mouse will permit the analysis of previously inaccessible neuronal populations and chronic imaging from genetically identified neurons in vivo.},

abstract = {We derive a new self-organising learning algorithm which maximises
the information transferred in a network of non-linear units. The
algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions,
and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions,
information maximisation has extra properties not found in the linear
case (Linsker 1989). The non-linearities in the transfer function
are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions
and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units
in the output representation. This enables the network to separate
statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order
generalisation of Principal Components Analysis. We apply the network
to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully
separating unknown mixtures of up to ten speakers. We also show that
a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution
(cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal).
Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays.
We suggest that information maximisation provides a unifying framework
for problems in 'blind' signal processing.},

@article{Yu2000,
abstract = {At the level of the cochlear nucleus (CN), the auditory pathway divides into several parallel circuits, each of which provides a different representation of the acoustic signal. Here, the representation of the power spectrum of an acoustic signal is analyzed for two CN principal cells-chopper neurons of the ventral CN and type IV neurons of the dorsal CN. The analysis is based on a weighting function model that relates the discharge rate of a neuron to first- and second-order transformations of the power spectrum. In chopper neurons, the transformation of spectral level into rate is a linear (i.e., first-order) or nearly linear function. This transformation is a predominantly excitatory process involving multiple frequency components, centered in a narrow frequency range about best frequency, that usually are processed independently of each other. In contrast, type IV neurons encode spectral information linearly only near threshold. At higher stimulus levels, these neurons are strongly inhibited by spectral notches, a behavior that cannot be explained by level transformations of first- or second-order. Type IV weighting functions reveal complex excitatory and inhibitory interactions that involve frequency components spanning a wider range than that seen in choppers. These findings suggest that chopper and type IV neurons form parallel pathways of spectral information transmission that are governed by two different mechanisms. Although choppers use a predominantly linear mechanism to transmit tonotopic representations of spectra, type IV neurons use highly nonlinear processes to signal the presence of wide-band spectral features.},

@article{Woolrich2008,
abstract = {Neuroimaging group studies are typically performed with the assumption that subjects used are randomly drawn from a population of subjects. The population of subjects is assumed to have a distribution of effect sizes associated with it that are Gaussian distributed. However, in practice, group studies can include "outlier" subjects whose effect sizes are completely at odds with the general population for reasons that are not of experimental interest. If ignored, these outliers can dramatically affect the inference results. To solve this problem, we propose a group inference approach which includes inference of outliers using a robust general linear model (GLM) approach. This approach models the errors as being a mixture of two Gaussian distributions, one for the normal population and one for the outliers. Crucially the robust GLM is part of a traditional hierarchical group model which uses GLMs at each level of the hierarchy. This combines the benefits of outlier inference with the benefits of using variance information from lower levels in the hierarchy. A Bayesian inference framework is used to infer on the robust GLM, while using the lower level variance information. The performance of the method is demonstrated on simulated and fMRI data and is compared with iterative reweighted least squares and permutation testing.},

abstract = {1. The propagation of antidromically activated action potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons was examined with intrasomatic and intradendritic electrical recording and optical measurements using the fluorescent calcium indicator Calcium Green-1. 2. In somatic recordings, trains of 40 action potentials, activated at rates up to 100 Hz, showed modest amplitude reduction. Recordings in the apical dendrites, 150 microns from the soma, showed smaller initial amplitudes and much greater decrement during trains. Higher frequencies caused a greater rate of reduction with a lower final amplitude. 3. Calcium concentration changes ([Ca2+]i), measured with the fluorescent indicator Calcium Green-1 and a fast, cooled charge coupled device (CCD) camera, were detected over the entire length of the apical dendrites in response to single antidromic action potentials, although the changes in distal dendrites were smaller. These changes were rapid, decaying to half-amplitude in < 150 ms in distal dendritic locations. 4. Trains of action potentials at all frequencies up to 100 Hz caused transient [Ca2+]i, increases for each spike at 150 microns from the soma. In the last 100 microns of the distal branches, only the first few spikes caused a [Ca2+]i increase for frequencies above approximately 40 Hz. These patterns could be matched with a simple model of calcium influx and removal, where later spikes in a train brought in less calcium than earlier spikes. 5. These results show that the action-potential amplitude and the spatial extent of their propagation in the dendrites is frequency dependent.},

However, all of them use the Euclidean distance to construct the graph Laplacian, which does not necessarily reflect the inherent distribution of the data. In this brief, we propose a method to directly optimize the normalized graph Laplacian by using pairwise constraints. The learned graph is consistent with equivalence and nonequivalence pairwise relationships, and thus it can better represent similarity between samples. Meanwhile, our approach, unlike metric learning, automatically determines the scale factor during the optimization. The learned normalized Laplacian matrix can be directly applied in spectral clustering and semisupervised learning algorithms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Most studies investigating neural representations of species-specific vocalizations in non-human primates and other species have involved studying neural responses to vocalization tokens. One limitation of such approaches is the difficulty in determining which acoustical features of vocalizations evoke neural responses. Traditionally used filtering techniques are often inadequate in manipulating features of complex vocalizations. Furthermore, the use of vocalization tokens cannot fully account for intrinsic stochastic variations of vocalizations that are crucial in understanding the neural codes for categorizing and discriminating vocalizations differing along multiple feature dimensions. In this work, we have taken a rigorous and novel approach to the study of species-specific vocalization processing by creating parametric "virtual vocalization" models of major call types produced by the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The main findings are as follows. 1) Acoustical parameters were measured from a database of the four major call types of the common marmoset. This database was obtained from eight different individuals, and for each individual, we typically obtained hundreds of samples of each major call type. 2) These feature measurements were employed to parameterize models defining representative virtual vocalizations of each call type for each of the eight animals as well as an overall species-representative virtual vocalization averaged across individuals for each call type. 3) Using the same feature-measurement that was applied to the vocalization samples, we measured acoustical features of the virtual vocalizations, including features not explicitly modeled and found the virtual vocalizations to be statistically representative of the callers and call types. 4) The accuracy of the virtual vocalizations was further confirmed by comparing neural responses to real and synthetic virtual vocalizations recorded from awake marmoset auditory cortex. We found a strong agreement between the responses to token vocalizations and their synthetic counterparts. 5) We demonstrated how these virtual vocalization stimuli could be employed to precisely and quantitatively define the notion of vocalization "selectivity" by using stimuli with parameter values both within and outside the naturally occurring ranges. We also showed the potential of the virtual vocalization stimuli in studying issues related to vocalization categorizations by morphing between different call types and individual callers.},

A cognitive model predicted the distribution of solution times from measures of problem complexity. Separately, a linear discriminant analysis used fMRI data to predict whether or not students were engaged in problem solving. A hidden Markov algorithm merged these two sources of information to predict the mental states of students during problem-solving episodes. The algorithm was trained on data from 1 day of interaction and tested with data from a later day. In terms of predicting what state a student was in during a 2-s period, the algorithm achieved 87\% accuracy on the training data and 83\% accuracy on the test data. The results illustrate the importance of integrating the bottom-up information from imaging data with the top-down information from a cognitive model.},

abstract = {Summary. The mixture model is a method of choice for modeling heterogeneous random graphs, because it contains most of the known structures of heterogeneity: hubs, hierarchical structures, or community structure. One of the weaknesses of mixture models on random graphs is that, at the present time, there is no computationally feasible estimation method that is completely satisfying from a theoretical point of view. Moreover, mixture models assume that each vertex pertains to one group, so there is no place for vertices being at intermediate positions. The model proposed in this article is a grade of membership model for heterogeneous random graphs, which assumes that each vertex is a mixture of extremal hypothetical vertices. The connectivity properties of each vertex are deduced from those of the extreme vertices. In this new model, the vector of weights of each vertex are fixed continuous parameters. A model with a vector of parameters for each vertex is tractable because the number of observations is proportional to the square of the number of vertices of the network. The estimation of the parameters is given by the maximum likelihood procedure. The model is used to elucidate some of the processes shaping the heterogeneous structure of a well-resolved network of host/parasite interactions.},

abstract = {We derive from the path integral a continuum strong-coupling expansion
for QED in d-dimensional Euclidean space-time. It is a double expansion
in the fermion and boson kinetic energy (inverse free propagators),
which leads to a double power series for the Green's functions of
the cutoff theory in terms of 1/e\^{}2 and Lambda\^{}2/M\^{}2. Lambda is a
smooth cutoff in Euclidean momentum space, and M is an infrared regulator
mass for the photons needed to define the local part of the path
integral. We demonstrate how dimensional continuation is necessary
to control the broken gauge invariance of the cutoff theory. Restricting
to d=2 (the Schwinger model) we show how to remove the cutoff using
Pade approximants. We find some evidence that as Lambda\^{}2/M\^{}2->infty
gauge invariance is restored and we calculate the vector-meson mass,
keeping the first three terms in the expansion in powers of the bare
photon inverse propagator.},

for the recording of fast neuronal activity in a 3D volume. The system
uses an Yb:KYW femtosecond laser we designed for use with acousto-optic
deflection. An integrated two-axis acousto-optic deflector, driven
by digitally synthesized signals, can target locations in three dimensions.
Data acquisition and the control of scanning are performed by a LeCroy
digital oscilloscope. The total cost of construction was one order
of magnitude lower than that of a typical Ti:sapphire system. The
entire imaging apparatus, including the laser, fits comfortably onto
a small rig for electrophysiology. Despite the low cost and simplicity,
the convergence of several new technologies allowed us to achieve
the following capabilities: i) full-frame acquisition at video rates
suitable for patch clamping; ii) random access in under ten microseconds
with dwelling ability in the nominal focal plane; iii) three-dimensional
random access with the ability to perform fast volume sweeps at kilohertz
rates; and iv) fluorescence lifetime imaging. We demonstrate the
ability to record action potentials with high temporal resolution
using intracellularly loaded potentiometric dye di-2-ANEPEQ. Our
design proffers easy integration with electrophysiology and promises
a more widespread adoption of functional two-photon imaging as a

Yet regaining a habit can occur quickly, with even one or a few exposures to cues previously triggering the behaviour. To identify neural mechanisms that might underlie such learning dynamics, we made long-term recordings from multiple neurons in the sensorimotor striatum, a basal ganglia structure implicated in habit formation, in rats successively trained on a reward-based procedural task, given extinction training and then given reacquisition training. The spike activity of striatal output neurons, nodal points in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, changed markedly across multiple dimensions during each of these phases of learning. First, new patterns of task-related ensemble firing successively formed, reversed and then re-emerged. Second, task-irrelevant firing was suppressed, then rebounded, and then was suppressed again. These changing spike activity patterns were highly correlated with changes in behavioural performance. We propose that these changes in task representation in cortico-basal ganglia circuits represent neural equivalents of the explore-exploit behaviour characteristic of habit learning.},

abstract = {A diffusion deconvolution method is proposed to apply deconvolution to the diffusion orientation distribution function (dODF) and calculate the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF), which is defined as the orientation distribution of the fiber spin density. The dODF can be obtained from q-space imaging methods such as q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), and thus the method can be applied to various diffusion sampling schemes. A phantom study was conducted to compare the angular resolution of the fODF with the dODF, and the in vivo datasets were acquired using single-shell, two-shell, and grid sampling schemes, which were then reconstructed by QBI, GQI, and DSI, respectively. The phantom study showed that the fODF significantly improved the angular resolution over the dODF at 45- and 60-degree crossing angles. The in vivo study showed consistent fODF regardless of the applied sampling schemes and reconstruction methods, and the ability to resolve crossing fibers was improved in reduced sampling condition. The fiber spin density obtained from deconvolution showed a higher contrast-to-noise ratio than the fractional anisotropy (FA) mapping, and further application on tractography showed that the fiber spin density can be used to determine the termination of fiber tracts. In conclusion, the proposed deconvolution method is generally applicable to different q-space imaging methods. The calculated fODF improves the angular resolution and also provides a quantitative index of fiber spin density to refine fiber tracking.},

abstract = {Rayleigh's criterion is extensively used in optical microscopy for determining the resolution of microscopes. This criterion imposes a resolution limit that has long been held as an impediment for studying nanoscale biological phenomenon through an optical microscope. However, it is well known that Rayleigh's criterion is based on intuitive notions. For example, Rayleigh's criterion is formulated in a deterministic setting that neglects the photon statistics of the acquired data. Hence it does not take into account the number of detected photons, which, in turn, raises concern over the use of Rayleigh's criterion in photon-counting techniques such as single-molecule microscopy. Here, we re-examine the resolution problem by adopting a stochastic framework and present a resolution measure that overcomes the limitations of Rayleigh's criterion. This resolution measure predicts that the resolution of optical microscopes is not limited and that it can be improved by increasing the number of detected photons. Experimental verification of the resolution measure is carried out by imaging single-molecule pairs with different distances of separation. The resolution measure provides a quantitative tool for designing and evaluating single-molecule experiments that probe biomolecular interactions.},

We propose that alternating fast and slow waves consolidate information acquired previously during wakefulness.

abstract = {In neocortical neurons, network activity can activate a large number of synaptic inputs, resulting in highly irregular subthreshold membrane potential (V(m)) fluctuations, commonly called "synaptic noise." This activity contains information about the underlying network dynamics, but it is not easy to extract network properties from such complex and irregular activity. Here, we propose a method to estimate properties of network activity from intracellular recordings and test this method using theoretical and experimental approaches. The method is based on the analytic expression of the subthreshold V(m) distribution at steady state in conductance-based models. Fitting this analytic expression to V(m) distributions obtained from intracellular recordings provides estimates of the mean and variance of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. We test the accuracy of these estimates against computational models of increasing complexity. We also test the method using dynamic-clamp recordings of neocortical neurons in vitro. By using an on-line analysis procedure, we show that the measured conductances from spontaneous network activity can be used to re-create artificial states equivalent to real network activity. This approach should be applicable to intracellular recordings during different network states in vivo, providing a characterization of the global properties of synaptic conductances and possible insight into the underlying network mechanisms.},

This reagent incorporates into actin-containing structures and allows the visualization of actin dynamics in living neurons. In mature neurons, recordings of GFP fluorescence revealed large actin-dependent changes in dendritic spine shape, similar to those inferred from previous studies using fixed tissues. Visible changes occurred within seconds, suggesting that anatomical plasticity at synapses can be extremely rapid.

However, when these time-varying responses were examined across many PNs, concentration-specific patterns clustered by identity, resolving the apparent confound. This is because PN ensemble representations changed relatively continuously over a range of concentrations of each odorant. The PNs' targets in the mushroom body-Kenyon cells (KCs)-had sparse identity-specific responses with diverse degrees of concentration invariance. The tuning of KCs to identity and concentration and the patterning of their responses are consistent with piecewise decoding of their PN inputs over oscillation-cycle length epochs.},

abstract = {When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information
that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at
which the image operators are applied. This article presents a systematic
methodology for addressing this problem. A mechanism is presented
for automatic selection of scale levels when detecting one-dimensional
image features, such as edges and ridges. A novel concept of a scale-space
edge is introduced, defined as a connected set of points in scale-space
at which: (i) the gradient magnitude a ssumes a local maximum in
the gradient direction, and (ii) a normalized measure of the strength
of the edge response is locally maximal over scales. An important
consequence of this defi nition is that it allows the scale levels
to vary along the edge. Two specific measures of edge strength are
analysed in detail, the gradient magnitude and a differential expression
derived from the third-order derivative in the gradient direction.
For a certain way of normalizing these differential descriptors,
by expressing them in terms of so-called -normalized derivatives,
an immediate consequence of this deffnition is that the edge detector
will adapt its scale levels to the local image structure. Specifically,
sharp edges will be detected at scales so as to reduce the shape
distortions due to scale-space smoothing, whereas sufficiently coarse
scales will be selected at diffuse edges, such that an edge model
is a valid abstraction of the intensity profile across the edge.
Since the scale-space edge is defined from the intersection of two
zero-crossing surfaces in scale-space, the edges will by definition
form closed curves. This simplified selection of salient edges, and
a novel significance measure is proposed, by integrating the edge
strength along the edge. Moreover, the scale information associated
with each edge provides useful clues to the physical nature of the
edge. With just slight modifications, similar ideas can be used for
formulating ridge detectors with automatic selection, having the
characteristic property that the selected scales on a scale-space
ridge instead reject the width of the ridge. It is shown how the
methodology can be implemented in terms of straightforward visual
front-end operations, and the validity of the approach is supported
by theoretical analysis as well as experiments on real-world and
synthetic data. Keywords: edge detection, ridge detection, scale

abstract = {The intracellular events on the recycling pathway that lead from sorting endosomes to exocytosis at the plasma membrane are central to cellular function. However, despite intensive study, these processes are poorly characterized in spatial and dynamic terms. The primary reason for this is that, to date, it has not been possible to visualize rapidly moving intracellular compartments in three dimensions in cells. Here, we use a recently developed imaging setup in which multiple planes can be simultaneously imaged within the cell in conjunction with visualization of the plasma membrane plane by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This has allowed us to track and characterize intracellular events on the recycling pathway that lead to exocytosis of the MHC Class I-related receptor, FcRn. We observe both direct delivery of tubular and vesicular transport containers (TCs) from sorting endosomes to exocytic sites at the plasma membrane, and indirect pathways in which TCs that are not in proximity to sorting endosomes undergo exocytosis. TCs can also interact with different sorting endosomes before exocytosis. Our data provide insight into the intracellular events that precede exocytic fusion.},

abstract = {This copy covers both volumesNow in an extensively revised and updated second edition, these essential volumes cover all aspects of child and adolescent assessment. Leading clinical scientists summarize the state of the science of assessment paradigms, instruments, and methods. With an emphasis on practical clinical considerations, chapters also delve into issues related to test development, psychometrics, and bias. Conveniently designed for reference or text use, this vast knowledge base has been synthesized into two volumes which may be purchased separately or together. INTELLIGENCE, APTITUDE, AND ACHIEVEMENT surveys assessment of intelligence, learning styles, and academic achievement; covers historical issues and psychometric methods; and addresses diversity issues, ethical concerns, and special topics in mental testing. PERSONALITY, BEHAVIOR, AND CONTEXT reviews the use of projective methods, interviewing and observation, and objective methods of assessing personality and behavior; discusses the assessment of specific syndromes and symptoms; and presents tools for assessing adaptive skills and the family context. New in the Second EditionBoth volumes in the second edition have been substantially rewritten to include over a decade's worth of conceptual and empirical advances; numerous new and emerging applications; and the latest professional standards. Highlights of INTELLIGENCE, APTITUDE, AND ACHIEVEMENT include new chapters on applications of the KAIT and DAS, the value of multifactored and cross-battery ability assessments, assessment of memory and of writing skills, preschool intellectual assessment, and assessment of children with language impairments or traumaticbrain injury. PERSONALITY, BEHAVIOR, AND CONTEXT features new chapters on classroom observations, structured diagnostic interviewing, ADHD assessment, uses of the BASC and the ASEBA, assessment of childhood anxiety, and more},

abstract = {Motor adaptation is usually defined as the process by which our nervous system produces accurate movements while the properties of our bodies and our environment continuously change. Many experimental and theoretical studies have characterized this process by assuming that the nervous system uses internal models to compensate for motor errors. Here we extend these approaches and construct a probabilistic model that not only compensates for motor errors but estimates the sources of these errors. These estimates dictate how the nervous system should generalize. For example, estimated changes of limb properties will affect movements across the workspace but not movements with the other limb. We provide evidence that many movement-generalization phenomena emerge from a strategy by which the nervous system estimates the sources of our motor errors.},

abstract = {We imaged axons in layer (L) 1 of the mouse barrel cortex in vivo. Axons from thalamus and L2/3/5, or L6 pyramidal cells were identified based on their distinct morphologies. Their branching patterns and sizes were stable over times of months. However, axonal branches and boutons displayed cell type-specific rearrangements. Structural plasticity in thalamocortical afferents was mostly due to elongation and retraction of branches (range, 1-150 microm over 4 days; approximately 5\% of total axonal length), while the majority of boutons persisted for up to 9 months (persistence over 1 month approximately 85\%). In contrast, L6 axon terminaux boutons were highly plastic (persistence over 1 month approximately 40 \%), and other intracortical axon boutons showed intermediate levels of plasticity. Retrospective electron microscopy revealed that new boutons make synapses. Our data suggest that structural plasticity of axonal branches and boutons contributes to the remodeling of specific functional circuits.},

abstract = {Storing memories of ongoing, everyday experiences requires a high degree of plasticity, but retaining these memories demands protection against changes induced by further activity and experience. Models in which memories are stored through switch-like transitions in synaptic efficacy are good at storing but bad at retaining memories if these transitions are likely, and they are poor at storage but good at retention if they are unlikely. We construct and study a model in which each synapse has a cascade of states with different levels of plasticity, connected by metaplastic transitions. This cascade model combines high levels of memory storage with long retention times and significantly outperforms alternative models. As a result, we suggest that memory storage requires synapses with multiple states exhibiting dynamics over a wide range of timescales, and we suggest experimental tests of this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Validation is often defined as the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of its intended uses. Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend increasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. We propose to formulate the validation of a given model as an iterative construction process that mimics the often implicit process occurring in the minds of scientists. We offer a formal representation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model. Thus, we replace static claims on the impossibility of validating a given model by a dynamic process of constructive approximation. This approach is better adapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure factors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for validation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations. We illustrate the methodology first with the maturation of quantum mechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several concrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a cellular automaton model for earthquakes, a multifractal random walk model for financial time series, an anomalous diffusion model for solar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid dynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.},

abstract = {1. Intracellular recordings were made from identified cartwheel and stellate cells in the molecular and fusiform cell layers of the murine dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). The aim of the study was to identify and characterize their synaptic inputs and to learn how synaptic inputs and intrinsic electrical properties interact to generate firing patterns. 2. Eight cells labeled by the intracellular injection of biocytin were cartwheel cells. Their axon terminals extended from the deep part of the molecular layer through the fusiform cell layer. Their dendrites extended through the molecular layer and had spines. Both the dendritic and axonal arbors were small, having diameters of approximately 150 microns in the parasagittal plane. 3. When depolarized, cartwheel cells often fired bursts of rapid action potentials superimposed on a slow depolarization. The peaks of action potentials were usually overshooting. Individually occurring action potentials were followed by two afterhyperpolarizations, as in other cells of the DCN. During bursts, action potentials did not have two distinct repolarizing phases. 4. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded from cartwheel cells spontaneously and after shocks to the nerve root or to the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). The EPSPs rose slowly. When they were suprathreshold they evoked action potentials singly or in bursts. EPSPs evoked by shocks to the nerve root or to the VCN had long latencies, the rise of EPSPs beginning between 5 and 10 ms after the shock. No inhibitory synaptic potentials, either spontaneous or driven with electrical stimulation, were detected in cells whose resting potentials were between -50 and -70 mV. 5. The locations from which excitatory input can be driven electrically are consistent with cartwheel cells receiving excitatory synaptic input from granule cells. 6. One labeled cell was a superficial stellate cell. It had smooth, straight dendrites that radiated parallel to the layers of the DCN; its axonal arbor was also planar and was restricted to the molecular layer. Both the dendritic and axonal arbors of this stellate cell were large, > 500 microns diam in the parasagittal plane. 7. The superficial stellate cell fired trains of action potentials at regular intervals that, like other cells of the DCN, were overshooting and were followed by double undershoots. 8. Shocks to the nerve root and to the surface of the VCN evoked EPSPs after 3.5 and 2 ms, respectively, in the superficial stellate cell. Chemical stimulation of the VCN also evoked excitation. No inhibitory synaptic input, spontaneous or driven, was detected.},

the ability to simultaneously monitor neuronal activity at multiple
cellular sites. While the difficulties of accessing dendritic submicron
structures with conventional micropipette approaches are generally
overcome by optical recording techniques, their spatio-temporal resolution
has limited such studies to few sites or slow signals. Here we present
a novel approach to functional imaging, termed random-access multiphoton
(RAMP) microscopy, which combines multiphoton excitation with an
inertia-free scanning mechanism. RAMP microscopy employs two-dimensional
acousto-optic deflection to rapidly position a focused near-infrared
ultrafast laser beam between dwell periods at multiple user-selected
sites. Because neuronal structures are generally sparse, activity
located throughout various compartments, including thin dendritic
branches and spines, can be mapped at high frame rates while maintaining
the signal-to-noise ratio of conventional scanning microscopy. Moreover,
RAMP microscopy maintains the excellent structural imaging capability
of multiphoton excitation, i.e., intrinsic optical sectioning and
high lateral resolution from within highly light-scattering brain
tissue. RAMP microscopy thus comprises a versatile tool for investigating
correlations of dendritic structure and function with significantly
enhanced experimental throughput.},

abstract = {Understanding the biophysical properties of single neurons and how they process information is fundamental to understanding how the brain works. A technique that would allow recording of temporal and spatial dynamics of electrical activity in neuronal processes with adequate resolution would facilitate further research. Here, we report on the application of optical recording of membrane potential transients at many sites on neuronal processes of vertebrate neurons in brain slices using intracellular voltage-sensitive dyes. We obtained evidence that 1) loading the neurons with voltage-sensitive dye using patch electrodes is possible without contamination of the extracellular environment; 2) brain slices do not show any autofluorescence at the excitation/emission wavelengths used; 3) pharmacological effects of the dye were completely reversible; 4) the level of photodynamic damage already allows meaningful measurements and could be reduced further; 5) the sensitivity of the dye was comparable to that reported for invertebrate neurons; 6) the dye spread approximately 500 micron into distal processes within 2 h incubation period. This distance should increase with longer incubation; 7) the optically recorded action potential signals from basolateral dendrites (that are difficult or impossible to approach by patch electrodes) and apical dendrites show that both direct soma stimulation and synaptic stimulation triggered action potentials that originated near the soma. The spikes backpropagated into both basolateral dendrites and apical processes; the propagation was somewhat faster in the apical dendrites.},

abstract = {Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly before a postsynaptic neuron and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron's response variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron's output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an objective function that minimizes response variability and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena, including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic efficacy increases. We compare our account to other efforts to derive STDP from computational principles and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of unsupervised cortical adaptation.},

abstract = {Traditional techniques for investigating cultured neural networks, such as the patch clamp and multi-electrode array, are limited by: (1) the number of identified cells which can be simultaneously electrically contacted, (2) the length of time for which cells can be studied, and (3) the lack of one-to-one neuron-to-electrode specificity. Here, we present a new device - the caged neuron multi-electrode array - which overcomes these limitations. This micro-machined device consists of an array of neurocages which mechanically trap a neuron near an extracellular electrode. While the cell body is trapped, the axon and dendrites can freely grow into the surrounding area to form a network. The electrode is bi-directional, capable of both stimulating and recording action potentials. This system is non-invasive, so that all constituent neurons of a network can be studied over its lifetime with stable one-to-one neuron-to-electrode correspondence. Proof-of-concept experiments are described to illustrate that functional networks form in a neurochip system of 16 cages in a 4 x 4 array, and that suprathreshold connectivity can be fully mapped over several weeks. The neurochip opens a new domain in neurobiology for studying small cultured neural networks.},

abstract = {Models of whole-brain connectivity are valuable for understanding neurological function, development and disease. This paper presents a machine learning based approach to classify subjects according to their approximated structural connectivity patterns and to identify features which represent the key differences between groups. Brain networks are extracted from diffusion magnetic resonance images obtained by a clinically viable acquisition protocol. Connections are tracked between 83 regions of interest automatically extracted by label propagation from multiple brain atlases followed by classifier fusion. Tracts between these regions are propagated by probabilistic tracking, and mean anisotropy measurements along these connections provide the feature vectors for combined principal component analysis and maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis. The approach is tested on two populations with different age distributions: 20-30 and 60-90 years. We show that subjects can be classified successfully (with 87.46\% accuracy) and that the features extracted from the discriminant analysis agree with current consensus on the neurological impact of ageing.},

@article{Wu2009,
abstract = {The Kalman filter has been proposed as a model to decode neural activity measured from the motor cortex in order to obtain real-time estimates of hand motion in behavioral neurophysiological experiments. However, currently used linear state-space models underlying the Kalman filter do not take into account other behavioral states such as muscular activity or the subject's level of attention, which are often unobservable during experiments but may play important roles in characterizing neural controlled hand movement. To address this issue, we depict these unknown states as one multidimensional hidden state in the linear state-space framework. This new model assumes that the observed neural firing rate is directly related to this hidden state. The dynamics of the hand state are also allowed to impact the dynamics of the hidden state, and vice versa. The parameters in the model can be identified by a conventional expectation-maximization algorithm. Since this model still uses the linear Gaussian framework, hand-state decoding can be performed by the efficient Kalman filter algorithm. Experimental results show that this new model provides a more appropriate representation of the neural data and generates more accurate decoding. Furthermore, we have used recently developed computationally efficient methods by incorporating a priori information of the targets of the reaching movement. Our results show that the hidden-state model with target-conditioning further improves decoding accuracy.},

abstract = {The assessment of Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DW-MRI) fibre-tracking algorithms has been limited by the lack of an appropriate 'gold standard'. Practical limitations of alternative methods and physical models have meant that numerical simulations have become the method of choice in practice. However, previous numerical phantoms have consisted of separate fibres embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not capture the true nature of white matter. In this paper we describe a method that is able to randomly generate numerical structures consisting of densely packed bundles of fibres, which are much more representative of human white matter, and simulate the DW-MR images that would arise from them under many imaging conditions. User-defined parameters may be adjusted to produce structures with a range of complexities that spans the levels we would expect to find in vivo. These structures are shown to contain many different features that occur in human white matter and which could confound fibre-tracking algorithms, such as tract kissing and crossing. Furthermore, combinations of such features can be sampled by the random generation of many different structures with consistent levels of complexity. The proposed software provides means for quantitative assessment via direct comparison between tracking results and the exact location of the generated fibres. This should greatly improve our understanding of algorithm performance and therefore prove an important tool for fibre tracking development.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework for the function of the medial temporal lobe system in memory defines differential contributions of the hippocampal subregions with regard to pattern recognition retrieval processes and encoding of new information. To investigate molecular programs of relevance, we designed a spatial learning protocol to engage a pattern separation function to encode new information. After background training, two groups of animals experienced the same new training in a novel environment; however, only one group was provided spatial information and demonstrated spatial memory in a retention test. Global transcriptional analysis of the microdissected subregions of the hippocampus exposed a CA3 pattern that was sufficient to clearly segregate spatial learning animals from control. Individual gene and functional group analysis anchored these results to previous work in neural plasticity. From a multitude of expression changes, increases in camk2a, rasgrp1, and nlgn1 were confirmed by in situ hybridization. Furthermore, siRNA inhibition of nlgn1 within the CA3 subregion impaired spatial memory performance, pointing to mechanisms of synaptic remodeling as a basis for rapid encoding of new information in long-term memory.},

abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

abstract = {Automated analysis of C. elegans behaviour is a rapidly developing field, offering the possibility of behaviour-based, high-throughput drug screens and systematic phenotyping. Standard methods for parameterizing worm shapes and movements are emerging, and progress has been made towards overcoming the difficulties introduced by interactions between worms, as well as worm coiling and omega turning. Current methods have facilitated the identification of subtle phenotypes and the characterisation of roles of neurones in forward locomotion and chemotaxis, as well as the quantitative characterisation of behaviour choice and circadian patterns of activity. Given the speed with which C. elegans has been deployed in genetic screens and chemical screens, it is to be hoped that wormtrackers may eventually provide similar rapidity in assaying behavioural phenotypes. However, considerable progress must be made before this can be accomplished. In the case of genome-wide RNAi screens, for example, the presence in the worm genome of some 19,000 genes means that even the minimal user intervention in an automatic phenotyping system will be very costly. Nonetheless, recent advances have shown that drug actions on large numbers of worms can be tracked, raising hopes that high-throughput behavioural screens may soon be available.},

abstract = {We describe a new fully automatic method for the segmentation of brain images that contain multiple sclerosis white matter lesions. Multichannel magnetic resonance images are used to delineate multiple sclerosis lesions while segmenting the brain into its major structures. The method is an atlas-based segmentation technique employing a topological atlas as well as a statistical atlas. An advantage of this approach is that all segmented structures are topologically constrained, thereby allowing subsequent processing such as cortical unfolding or diffeomorphic shape analysis techniques. Evaluation with both simulated and real data sets demonstrates that the method has an accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation methods, while simultaneously segmenting the whole brain.},

abstract = {The population vector (PV) algorithm and optimal linear estimation

(OLE) have been used to reconstruct movement by combining signals

from multiple neurons in the motor cortex. While these linear methods

are effective, recursive Bayesian decoding schemes, which are nonlinear,

can be more powerful when probability model assumptions are satisfied.

We have implemented a recursive Bayesian algorithm for reconstructing

hand movement from neurons in the motor cortex. The algorithm uses

a recently developed numerical method known as "particle filtering"

and follows the same general strategy as that used by Brown et al.

to reconstruct the path of a foraging rat from hippocampal place

cells. We investigated the method in a numerical simulation study

in which neural firing rate was assumed to be positive, but otherwise

a linear function of movement velocity, and preferred directions

were not uniformly distributed. In terms of mean-squared error, the

approach was approximately 10 times more efficient than the PV algorithm

and 5 times more efficient than OLE. Thus use of recursive Bayesian

decoding can achieve the accuracy of the PV algorithm (or OLE) with

approximately 10 times (or 5 times) fewer neurons. The method was

also used to reconstruct hand movement in an ellipse-drawing task

from 258 cells in the ventral premotor cortex. Recursive Bayesian

decoding was again more efficient than the PV and OLE methods, by

factors of roughly seven and three, respectively.},

abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) conveys information to hippocampal field
CA1 either directly by way of projections from principal neurons
in layer III, or indirectly by axons from layer II via the dentate
gyrus, CA3, and Schaffer collaterals. These two pathways differentially
influence activity in CA1, yet conclusive evidence is lacking whether
and to what extent they converge onto single CA1 neurons. Presently
we studied such convergence. Different neuroanatomical tracers injected
into layer III of EC and into CA3, respectively, tagged simultaneously
the direct entorhino-hippocampal fibers and the indirect innervation
of CA1 neurons by Schaffer collaterals. In slices of fixed brains
we intracellularly filled CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons in
stratum lacunosum-moleculare (LM) and stratum radiatum (SR). Sections
of these slices were scanned in a confocal laser scanning microscope.
3D-reconstruction was used to determine whether boutons of the labeled
input fibers were in contact with the intracellularly filled neurons.
We analyzed 12 pyramidal neurons and 21 interneurons. Perforant path
innervation to pyramidal neurons in our material was observed to
be denser than that from CA3. All pyramidal neurons and 17 of the
interneurons received contacts of both perforant pathway and Schaffer
input on their dendrites and cell bodies. Four interneurons, which
were completely embedded in LM, received only labeled perforant pathway
input. Thus, we found convergence of both projection systems on single
CA1 pyramidal and interneurons with dendrites that access the layers
where perforant pathway fibers and Schaffer collaterals end.},

A technique that would allow recording of temporal and spatial dynamics of electrical activity in neuronal processes with adequate resolution would facilitate further research. Here, we report on the application of optical recording of membrane potential transients at many sites on neuronal processes of vertebrate neurons in brain slices using intracellular voltage-sensitive dyes. We obtained evidence that 1) loading the neurons with voltage-sensitive dye using patch electrodes is possible without contamination of the extracellular environment; 2) brain slices do not show any autofluorescence at the excitation/emission wavelengths used; 3) pharmacological effects of the dye were completely reversible; 4) the level of photodynamic damage already allows meaningful measurements and could be reduced further; 5) the sensitivity of the dye was comparable to that reported for invertebrate neurons; 6) the dye spread approximately 500 micron into distal processes within 2 h incubation period. This distance should increase with longer incubation; 7) the optically recorded action potential signals from basolateral dendrites (that are difficult or impossible to approach by patch electrodes) and apical dendrites show that both direct soma stimulation and synaptic stimulation triggered action potentials that originated near the soma. The spikes backpropagated into both basolateral dendrites and apical processes; the propagation was somewhat faster in the apical dendrites.},

abstract = {Zebrafish embryos exhibit spontaneous contractions of the musculature
as early as 18-19 h post fertilization (hpf) when removed from their
protective chorion. These movements are likely initiated by early
embryonic central nervous system activity. We have made the observation
that narrowminded mutant embryos (hereafter, nrd(-/-)) lack normal
embryonic motor output upon dechorionation. However, these mutants
can swim and respond to tactile stimulation by larval stages of development.
nrd(-/-) embryos exhibit defects in neural crest development, slow
muscle development and also lack spinal mechanosensory neurons known
as Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons. At early developmental stages (i.e.
21-22 hpf) and while still in their chorions, nrd siblings (nrd(+/?))
exhibited contractions of the musculature at a rate similar to wild-type
embryos. Anatomical analysis indicated that RB neurons were present
in the motile embryos, but absent in the non-motile embryos, indicating
that the non-motile embryos were nrd(-/-) embryos. Further anatomical
analysis of nrd(-/-) embryos revealed errors in motoneuron axonal
pathfinding that persisted into the larval stage of development.
These errors were reversed when nrd(-/-) embryos were raised in high
[K(+)] beginning at 21 hpf, indicating that the abnormal axonal phenotypes
may be related to a lack of depolarizing activity early in development.
When activity was blocked with tricaine in wild-type embryos, motoneuron
phenotypes were similar to the motoneuron phenotypes in nrd(-/-)
embryos. These results implicate early embryonic activity in conjunction
with other factors as necessary for normal motoneuron development.},

@article{Garajova2008a,
abstract = {BACKGROUDS: Neoadjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy has become a
standard treatment of locally advanced rectal adenocarcinomas (LARA).
It leads to shrinkage of the tumor mass and subsequently to an increase
in complete resections (R0 resections), increasing a feasibility
of sphincter-sparing intervention avoiding colostomy. It is based
on concurrent application of fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine)
and radiotherapy (45 - 50,4 Gy). It shows less acute toxicity and
improves local control rate in comparison to adjuvant treatment.
Unfortunately, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is not beneficial for
all patients. The treatment response ranges from a complete pathological
remission (pCR, ypT0ypN0) to a resistance. It is reported that cca
15 percent of patients with advanced rectal cancer show pCR which
is indicative of improved long-term prognosis. DESIGN: The following
is a review of the significance of neoadjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy
in the treatment algorithm of patients with LARA and summary of potentional
clinical-pathological and molecular markers of response prediction
to neoadjuvant therapy. The most important clinical studies concern
serum tumor markers levels, clinical lymph node classification. The
components of the carcinogenic pathways are explored, including oncogenes,
tumor supressor genes, microsatellite instability (MSI) and potentional
markers involved in apoptosis, angiogionesis, proliferation as well
as metastasis and invasion, are reviewed. Finally, the role of specific
enzymes associated with the metabolism of fluoropyrimidines are examined.
CONCLUSIONS: No one marker has been consistently identified as clinically
applicable. Studies designed to determine the potentional markers
are hampered by various techniques as well as tumor heterogenity
and recent scientific approach--studying individual molecular markers.
Gene expression profiling analysis of multiple genes from the same
tumor is becoming reality. We suppose that this assessment will lead
in future in finding combination of markers for predicting prognosis
and response to therapy in rectal cancer.},

abstract = {During binocular rivalry, conflicting monocular images compete for access to consciousness in a stochastic, dynamical fashion. Recent human neuroimaging and psychophysical studies suggest that rivalry entails competitive interactions at multiple neural sites, including sites that retain eye-selective information. Rivalry greatly suppresses activity in the ventral pathway and attenuates visual adaptation to form and motion; nonetheless, some information about the suppressed stimulus reaches higher brain areas. Although rivalry depends on low-level inhibitory interactions, high-level excitatory influences promoting perceptual grouping and selective attention can extend the local dominance of a stimulus over space and time. Inhibitory and excitatory circuits considered within a hybrid model might account for the paradoxical properties of binocular rivalry and provide insights into the neural bases of visual awareness itself.},

abstract = {This paper presents an algebro-geometric solution to the problem of segmenting an unknown number of subspaces of unknown and varying dimensions from sample data points. We represent the subspaces with a set of homogeneous polynomials whose degree is the number of subspaces and whose derivatives at a data point give normal vectors to the subspace passing through the point. When the number of subspaces is known, we show that these polynomials can be estimated linearly from data; hence, subspace segmentation is reduced to classifying one point per subspace. We select these points optimally from the data set by minimizing certain distance function, thus dealing automatically with moderate noise in the data. A basis for the complement of each subspace is then recovered by applying standard PCA to the collection of derivatives (normal vectors). Extensions of GPCA that deal with data in a high-dimensional space and with an unknown number of subspaces are also presented. Our experiments on low-dimensional data show that GPCA outperforms existing algebraic algorithms based on polynomial factorization and provides a good initialization to iterative techniques such as K-subspaces and Expectation Maximization. We also present applications of GPCA to computer vision problems such as face clustering, temporal video segmentation, and 3D motion segmentation from point correspondences in multiple affine views.},

capacity of the model establishes that the perirhinal cortex alone

neural network models indicate could be recalled (recollected) by
all the remaining areas of the cerebral cortex. This efficiency and

providing a reason for the existence of a familiarity discrimination

Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96\% of the spikes (+/-2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains.

abstract = {The mossy fiber synapse between dentate granule cells and CA3 pyramidal

cells in the guinea pig hippocampus shows a robust short-term synaptic

enhancement. We have simultaneously measured presynaptic residual

free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and postsynaptic field potentials at this

synapse to examine the role of [Ca2+]i in this enhancement. Single

action potentials produced an increase in [Ca2+]i of 10-50 nM that

decayed to resting levels with a time constant of about 1 sec. Trains

of action potentials produced larger [Ca2+]i increases that returned

more slowly to resting levels. Following the onset of moderate frequency

stimulus trains (0.1-5 Hz), synaptic transmission and [Ca2+]i both

increased and eventually plateaued. During the steady-state phase

a linear relationship between [Ca2+]i and synaptic enhancement was

observed. During the initial buildup, however, [Ca2+]i rose more

rapidly than synaptic enhancement. Similarly, during the decay phase

immediately following termination of a stimulus train, [Ca2+]i returned

to prestimulus levels faster than synaptic enhancement. High concentrations

of the calcium buffer EGTA in the presynaptic terminal slowed the

buildup and decay of both [Ca2+]i and synaptic enhancement produced

by stimulus trains. Under these conditions, the time course of [Ca2+]i

and synaptic enhancement were well matched. This suggests that, despite

the differences in kinetic rates observed for normal buffering conditions,

increases in [Ca2+]i play a causal role in short-term enhancement.

An increase in [Ca2+]i of 10-30 nM produced a twofold enhancement.

We propose a simple kinetic model to explain these results. The model

assumes that synaptic enhancement is controlled by a Ca-dependent

first-order reaction. According to this scheme, a change in [Ca2+]i

alters neurotransmitter release, but the slow kinetics of the underlying

reaction introduces a temporal filter, producing a delay in the change

in synaptic enhancement.},

The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.3±0.07 ns FWHM to 6.92±0.02 ns FWHM (11.52±0.05 ns to 4.89±0.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless.

In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing.

the physiological properties of only a handful of retinal ganglion

summation. Based on the measured properties of these cells, we speculate
that they correspond to the smooth/large radiate cells recently identified
morphologically in the primate retina and may therefore provide visual
input to both the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus.
We further speculate that the upsilon cells may be the primate retina's

abstract = {We used rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) to examine the tuning of macaque inferior temporal cortical (IT) neurons to five sets of 25 shapes each that varied systematically along predefined shape dimensions. A comparison of the RSVP technique using 100-ms presentations with that using a longer duration showed that shape preference can be determined with RSVP. Using relatively complex shapes that vary along relatively simple shape dimensions, we found that the large majority of neurons preferred extremes of the shape configuration, extending the results of a previous study using simpler shapes and a standard testing paradigm. A population analysis of the neuronal responses demonstrated that, in general, IT neurons can represent the similarities among the shapes at an ordinal level, extending a previous study that used a smaller number of shapes and a categorization task. However, the same analysis showed that IT neurons do not faithfully represent the physical similarities among the shapes. The responses to the two-part shapes could be predicted, virtually perfectly, from the average of the responses to the respective two parts presented in isolation. We also showed that IT neurons adapt to the stimulus distribution statistics. The neural shape discrimination improved when a shape set with a narrower stimulus range was presented, suggesting that the tuning of IT neurons is not static but adapts to the stimulus distribution statistics, at least when stimulated at a high rate with a restricted set of stimuli.},

a motor neuron releases glutamate from 30-100 boutons onto the muscle

boutons of the NMJ is unknown. To address this, we created synapcam,

a version of the Ca2+ reporter Cameleon. Synapcam localizes to the

postsynaptic terminal and selectively reports Ca2+ influx through

glutamate receptors (GluRs) with single-impulse and single-bouton

resolution. GluR-based Ca2+ signals were uniform within a given connection

(that is, a given bouton/postsynaptic terminal pair) but differed

considerably among connections of an NMJ. A steep gradient of transmission

strength was observed along axonal branches, from weak proximal connections

to strong distal ones. Presynaptic imaging showed a matching axonal

gradient, with higher Ca2+ influx and exocytosis at distal boutons.

The results suggest that transmission strength is mainly determined

presynaptically at the level of individual boutons, possibly by one

or more factors existing in a gradient.},

@article{Srinivasan1999,
abstract = {We outline a different method of describing scalar field particle
production in a uniform electric field. In the standard approach,
the (analytically continued) harmonic oscillator paradigm is important
in describing particle production. In the gauges normally considered,
in which the four vector potential depends only on the time or space
coordinate, the system reduces to a non-relativistic effective Schr\^{A}¨odinger
equation with an inverted oscillator potential. The Bogolubov coefficients
are determined by tunnelling in this potential. In the Schwinger
proper time method of determining the effective Lagrangian, the analytically
continued propagator for the usual oscillator system is regarded
as the correct propagator for the inverted oscillator system and
is used to obtain the gauge invariant result. However, there is another
gauge in which the particle production process has striking similarities
with the one used to describe Hawking radiation in black holes. The
gauge we use to describe the electric field in is the lightcone gauge,
so named because the mode functions for a scalar field are found
to be singular on the lightcone. We use these modes in evaluating
the effective Lagrangian using the proper time technique. The key
feature of this analysis is that these modes can be explicitly \"{\i}¾“normalized\"{\i}¾”
by using the criterion that they reduce to the usual flat space modes
in the limit of the electric field tending to zero. This normalization
procedure allows one to determine the Schwinger proper time kernel
without using the analytical continuation of the harmonic oscillator
kernel that is resorted to in the standard analysis. We find that
the proper time kernel is not the same as the analytically continued
oscillator kernel though the effective Lagrangian is the standard
result as it should be. We also consider an example of a confined
electric field system using the lightcone gauge modes that has several
features of interest. In particular, our analysis indicates that
the Bogolubov coefficients, in taking the limit to the uniform electric
field case, are multiplied by energy dependent boundary factors that
have not been taken into account before.},

Scale mixtures of underlying normals are used in order to model flexibly the measurement errors and allow mixed categorical and continuous scales. A dynamic mixture of Dirichlet processes is used to characterize the latent response distributions.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Unraveling the structure and behavior of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) has always been a major goal of neuroscience. Understanding the wiring diagrams of the neuromuscular junction connectomes (full connectivity of nervous system neuronal components) is a starting point for this, as it helps in the study of the organizational and developmental properties of the mammalian CNS. The phenomenon of synapse elimination during developmental stages of the neuronal circuitry is such an example. Due to the organizational specificity of the axons in the connectomes, it becomes important to label and extract individual axons for morphological analysis. Features such as axonal trajectories, their branching patterns, geometric information, the spatial relations of groups of axons, etc. are of great interests for neurobiologists in the study of wiring diagrams. However, due to the complexity of spatial structure of the axons, automatically tracking and reconstructing them from microscopy images in 3D is an unresolved problem. In this article, AxonTracker-3D, an interactive 3D axon tracking and labeling tool is built to obtain quantitative information by reconstruction of the axonal structures in the entire innervation field. The ease of use along with accuracy of results makes AxonTracker-3D an attractive tool to obtain valuable quantitative information from axon datasets.

abstract = {Accurate measurement of postsynaptic potential amplitudes is a central requirement for the quantification of synaptic strength, dynamics of short-term and long-term plasticity, and vesicle-release statistics. However, the intracellular voltage is a filtered version of the underlying synaptic signal and so a method of accounting for the distortion caused by overlapping postsynaptic potentials must be used. Here a voltage-deconvolution technique is demonstrated that defilters the entire voltage trace to reveal an underlying signal of well-separated synaptic events. These isolated events can be cropped out and reconvolved to yield a set of isolated postsynaptic potentials from which voltage amplitudes may be measured directly-greatly simplifying this common task. The method also has the significant advantage of providing a higher temporal resolution of the dynamics of the underlying synaptic signal. The versatility of the method is demonstrated by a variety of experimental examples, including excitatory and inhibitory connections to neurons with passive membranes and those with activated voltage-gated currents. The deconvolved current-clamp voltage has many features in common with voltage-clamp current measurements. These similarities are analyzed using cable theory and a multicompartment cell reconstruction, as well as direct comparison to voltage-clamp experiments.},

abstract = {The deafness (dn/dn) mutant mouse provides a valuable model of human

congenital deafness. We investigated the properties of synaptic transmission

in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of normal and congenitally

deaf dn/dn mice. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked

by focal stimulation of single auditory nerve fibres, and measured

by whole-cell recordings from neurones in AVCN slices (mean postnatal

age = P13). Absolute amplitudes of both AMPA- and NMDA-mediated components

of evoked EPSCs were greater (170 \%) in deaf versus control animals.

Enhanced transmission in deaf mice was due to a presynaptic mechanism.

Variance-mean analysis revealed that the probability of transmitter

release was significantly greater in deaf (P(r) = 0.8) versus control

animals (P(r) = 0.5). Following high frequency stimulation, deaf

mice showed a greater depression of evoked EPSCs, and a significant

increase in the frequency of delayed-release (asynchronous) miniature

EPSCs (aEPSCs) (deaf 100 Hz vs. control 7 Hz). The acetoxymethyl

ester of EGTA (EGTA-AM) blocked the increase in miniature aEPSCs

and returned tetanic depression to control values. In deaf mice,

reduction of mean P(r) using cadmium caused an expected increase

in paired-pulse ratio (PPR). However, in the same cells, a similar

reduction in release by EGTA-AM did not result in a change in PPR,

demonstrating that a change may occur in P(r) without a concomitant

change in PPR. In many respects, transmission in deaf mice was found

to be remarkably similar to control mice, implying that many parameters

of synaptic transmission develop normally in these animals. The two

significant differences (higher P(r) and asynchronous release in

deaf mice) could both be reversed by the addition of EGTA-AM, suggesting

that endogenous calcium buffering may be impaired or undeveloped

in the presynaptic terminals of the auditory nerve in deaf mice.},

@article{RegehrAtluri95,
abstract = {Calcium ions act presynaptically to modulate synaptic strength and

to trigger neurotransmitter release. Here we detect stimulus-evoked

changes in residual free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in rat cerebellar granule

cell presynaptic terminals. Granule cell axons, known as parallel

fibers, and their associated boutons, were labeled with several calcium

indicators. When parallel fibers were extracellularly activated with

stimulus trains, calcium accumulated in the terminals, producing

changes in the fluorescence of the indicators. During the stimulus

train, the fluorescence change per pulse became progressively smaller

with the high affinity indicators Fura-2 and calcium green-2 but

remained constant with the low affinity dyes BTC and furaptra. In

addition, fluorescence transients of high affinity dyes were slower

than those of low affinity indicators, which appear to accurately

report the time course of calcium transients. Simulations show that

differences in the observed transients can be explained by the different

affinities and off rates of the fluorophores. The return of [Ca2+]i

to resting levels can be approximated by an exponential decay with

a time constant of 150 ms. On the basis of the degree of saturation

in the response of high affinity dyes observed during trains, we

estimate that each action potential increases [Ca2+]i in the terminal

by several hundred nanomolar. These findings indicate that in these

terminals [Ca2+]i transients are much larger and faster than those

observed in larger boutons, such as those at the neuromuscular junction.

Such rapid [Ca2+]i dynamics may be found in many of the terminals

in the mammalian brain that are similar in size to parallel fiber

boutons.},

@article{Shaked2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Histone-modifying enzymes are essential for a wide variety
of cellular processes dependent upon changes in gene expression.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) lead to the compaction of chromatin
and subsequent silencing of gene transcription, and they have recently
been implicated in a diversity of functions and dysfunctions in the
postnatal and adult brain including ocular dominance plasticity,
memory consolidation, drug addiction, and depression. Here we investigate
the role of HDACs in the generation of neurons and astrocytes in
the embryonic brain. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As a variety of HDACs are
expressed in differentiating neural progenitor cells, we have taken
a pharmacological approach to inhibit multiple family members. Inhibition
of class I and II HDACs in developing mouse embryos with trichostatin
A resulted in a dramatic reduction in neurogenesis in the ganglionic
eminences and a modest increase in neurogenesis in the cortex. An
identical effect was observed upon pharmacological inhibition of
HDACs in in vitro-differentiating neural precursors derived from
the same brain regions. A reduction in neurogenesis in ganglionic
eminence-derived neural precursors was accompanied by an increase
in the production of immature astrocytes. We show that HDACs control
neurogenesis by inhibition of the bone morphogenetic protein BMP2/4
signaling pathway in radial glial cells. HDACs function at the transcriptional
level by inhibiting and promoting, respectively, the expression of
Bmp2 and Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of BMP signaling. Inhibition
of the BMP2/4 signaling pathway restored normal levels of neurogenesis
and astrogliogenesis to both ganglionic eminence- and cortex-derived
cultures in which HDACs were inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
demonstrate a transcriptionally-based regulation of BMP2/4 signaling
by HDACs both in vivo and in vitro that is critical for neurogenesis
in the ganglionic eminences and that modulates cortical neurogenesis.
The results also suggest that HDACs may regulate the developmental
switch from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis that occurs in late
gestation.},

@article{Tuch2004,
abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful tool for mapping neural histoarchitecture in vivo. However, DTI can only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel due to the constraints of the tensor model. For example, DTI cannot resolve fibers crossing, bending, or twisting within an individual voxel. Intravoxel fiber crossing can be resolved using q-space diffusion imaging, but q-space imaging requires large pulsed field gradients and time-intensive sampling. It is also possible to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signal, but mixture modeling requires a model of the underlying diffusion process.Recently, it has been shown that the HARDI signal can be reconstructed model-independently using a spherical tomographic inversion called the Funk-Radon transform, also known as the spherical Radon transform. The resulting imaging method, termed q-ball imaging, can resolve multiple intravoxel fiber orientations and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion process such as Gaussianity or multi-Gaussianity. The present paper reviews the theory of q-ball imaging and describes a simple linear matrix formulation for the q-ball reconstruction based on spherical radial basis function interpolation. Open aspects of the q-ball reconstruction algorithm are discussed.},

Following a series of contacts with such blocks, value signals received through a "snout" that senses conductivity allow it to sort these blocks on the basis of differences in color associated with differences in their conductivity. Darwin IV represents a new approach to synthetic neural modeling (SNM), a technique in which large-scale computer simulations are employed to analyze the interactions among the nervous system, the phenotype, and the environment of a designed organism as behavior develops. Darwin IV retains the advantages of SNM while avoiding the difficulties and pitfalls of attempting to simulate a rich environment in addition to a brain.},

abstract = {1. We have recorded the responses of neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of barbiturate-anesthetized cats to the synthetic, steady-state-vowel sound /e/, presented over a range of stimulus intensities. 2. The responses of (putative) spherical bushy cells [primary-like (Pri) units] to the vowel resemble those of auditory-nerve fibers (ANFs) in terms of both rate and temporal encoding at low and moderate stimulus levels. It was not possible to study the responses of most Pri units at the highest stimulus level because of the large neurophonic component present in recordings from most primarylike units at higher stimulus levels. 3. The responses of many (putative) globular bushy cells [primarylike with notch (PN) units] to the vowel resemble those of ANFs; however, there appears to be greater heterogeneity in the responses of units in the PN population than in the Pri population in terms of both temporal and rate encoding. 4. Populations of stellate cells (chopper units) have degraded representations of the temporal information in ANF population discharge patterns in response to the vowel; this is consistent with the responses of these units to pure tones. Both regular (ChS) and irregular (ChT) chopper subpopulations, however, maintain better rate-place representations of the vowel spectrum than does the population of ANFs as a whole. The rate-place representations of the vowel spectrum by both chopper populations closely resemble those of low and medium spontaneous rate ANFs at most stimulus levels. 5. The data presented in this paper suggest that a functional partition of the AVCN chopper population could yield two distinct rate representations in response to a complex stimulus: one that is graded with stimulus level (over a 30 to 40 dB range) and that, even at rate saturation, maintains a "low contrast" stimulus representation; and a second that maintains a robust, "high contrast" stimulus representation at all levels but that confers less information about stimulus level.},

In this report, we describe correlations among electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal cells' highly variable dendritic morphology and their ability to adaptively cancel redundant inputs via an anti-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity. A subset of cells, those with the largest apical dendrites, are plastic, but those with the smallest dendrites are not. A model of the network's connectivity predicts that efficient redundancy reduction requires that nonplastic cells provide feedback input to those that are plastic. Anatomical results confirm the model's prediction of optimal network architecture. These results provide a demonstration of different roles for morphological/physiological variants of a single cell type within a neural network performing a well-defined function.},

For predictor spaces featuring complex dependency patterns between the involved variables, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data tends to be very small due to the high redundancy induced by the dependencies. In situations of this type, it is useful to approximate the high-dimensional predictor space through a low-dimensional manifold (i.e., a curve or a surface), and use the projections onto the manifold as compressed predictors in the regression problem. In the case that the intrinsic dimensionality of the predictor space equals one, we use the local principal curve algorithm for the the compression step. We provide a novel algorithm which extends this idea to local principal surfaces, thus covering cases of an intrinsic dimensionality equal to two, which is in principle extendible to manifolds of arbitrary dimension. We motivate and apply the novel techniques using astrophysical and oceanographic data examples.},

When q is properly chosen for small and moderate sample sizes, the MLqE can successfully trade bias for precision, resulting in a substantial reduction of the mean squared error. When the sample size is large and q tends to 1, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a proper asymptotic normality and efficiency of MLqE is established.},

So far, only PA-GFP, which is monomeric and gives 100-fold fluorescence contrast, could be applied for protein tracking. Here we describe a dual-color monomeric protein, photoswitchable cyan fluorescent protein (PS-CFP). PS-CFP is capable of efficient photoconversion from cyan to green, changing both its excitation and emission spectra in response to 405-nm light irradiation. Complete photoactivation of PS-CFP results in a 1,500-fold increase in the green-to-cyan fluorescence ratio, making it the highest-contrast monomeric photoactivatable fluorescent protein described to date. We used PS-CFP as a photoswitchable tag to study trafficking of human dopamine transporter in living cells. At moderate excitation intensities, PS-CFP can be used as a pH-stable cyan label for protein tagging and fluorescence resonance energy transfer applications.},

In a prior study, learning an operant sensory discrimination increased cortical excitability and target selectivity. Here, the prior task was separated into three behavioral phases. First, naive animals were exposed to stimulus-reward pairings from the prior study. These yoked animals did not have to discriminate to be rewarded and did not learn the discrimination. The plasticity observed in the prior study did not occur. Second, the animals were classically conditioned to discriminate the same stimuli in a simplified format. Learning was accompanied by increased sensory response strength and an increased range of sensory inputs eliciting responses. The third study recreated the original operant discrimination, and selectivity for task targets increased. These studies demonstrate that cognitive association between sensory stimuli and reinforcers accompanies adult experience-dependent cortical plasticity and suggest that selectivity in representation and action are linked.},

In this study, we demonstrate the use of single-cell electroporation for Ca(2+) indicator loading of individual neurons and small neuronal networks in rat neocortex in vitro and in vivo. Brief voltage pulses were delivered through glass pipettes positioned close to target cells. This approach resulted in reliable and rapid (within seconds) loading of somata and subsequent complete labeling of dendritic and axonal arborizations. By using simultaneous whole-cell recordings in brain slices, we directly addressed the effect of electroporation on neurons. Cell viability was high (about 85\%) with recovery from the membrane permeabilization occurring within a minute. Electrical properties of recovered cells were indistinguishable before and after electroporation. In addition, Ca(2+) transients with normal appearance could be evoked in dendrites, spines, and axonal boutons of electroporated cells. Using negative-stains of somata, targeted single-cell electroporation was equally applicable in vivo. We conclude that electroporation is a simple approach that permits Ca(2+) indicator loading of multiple cells with low background staining within a short amount of time, which makes it especially well suited for functional imaging of subcellular Ca(2+) dynamics in small neuronal networks.},

However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Ma},

abstract = {We introduce a two-dimensional integrate-and-fire model that combines an exponential spike mechanism with an adaptation equation, based on recent theoretical findings. We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96\% of the spikes (+/-2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological classes described in vitro.},

abstract = {Novel methodologies have been recently developed to characterize the microgeometry of neural tissues and porous structures via diffusion MRI data. In line with these previous works, this article provides a detailed mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates that helps to highlight the differences and similarities between various related q-space methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and diffusion orientation transform imaging (DOT). This formulation provides a direct relationship between the orientation distribution function (ODF) and the diffusion data without using any approximation. Under this relationship, the exact ODF can be computed by means of the Radon transform of the radial projection (in q-space) of the diffusion MRI signal. This new methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging (EQBI), was put into practice using an analytical ODF estimation in terms of spherical harmonics that allows obtaining model-free and model-based reconstructions. This work provides a new framework for combining information coming from diffusion data recorded on multiple spherical shells in q-space (hybrid diffusion imaging encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping ODF to a high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more efficient development of diffusion MRI experiments for obtaining better ODF estimates.},

abstract = {Lesions of spiral ganglion cells, representing a restricted sector of the auditory nerve array, produce immediate changes in the frequency tuning of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons. There is a loss of excitation at the lesion frequencies, yet responses to adjacent frequencies remain intact and new regions of activity appear. This leads to immediate changes in tuning and in tonotopic progression. Similar effects are seen after different methods of peripheral damage and in auditory neurons in other nuclei. The mechanisms that underlie these postlesion changes are unknown, but the acute effects seen in IC strongly suggest the "unmasking" of latent inputs by the removal of inhibition. In this study, we explore computational models of single neurons with a convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from a range of characteristic frequencies (CFs), which can simulate the narrow prelesion tuning of IC neurons, and account for the changes in CF tuning after a lesion. The models can reproduce the data if inputs are aligned relative to one another in a precise order along the dendrites of model IC neurons. Frequency tuning in these neurons approximates that seen physiologically. Removal of inputs representing a narrow range of frequencies leads to unmasking of previously subthreshold excitatory inputs, which causes changes in CF. Conversely, if all of the inputs converge at the same point on the cell body, receptive fields are broad and unmasking rarely results in CF changes. However, if the inhibition is tonic with no stimulus-driven component, then unmasking can still produce changes in CF.},

However, all available monomeric reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) have similar properties and switching characteristics, thereby limiting their use. Here, we introduce two bright green fluorescent RSFPs, bsDronpa and Padron, generated by extensive mutagenesis of the RSFP Dronpa, with unique absorption and switching characteristics. Whereas bsDronpa features a broad absorption spectrum extending into the UV, Padron displays a switching behavior that is reversed to that of all green fluorescent RSFPs known to date. These two RSFPs enable live-cell fluorescence microscopy with multiple labels using a single detection color, because they can be distinguished by photoswitching. Furthermore, we demonstrate dual-color fluorescence microscopy with sub-diffraction resolution using bsDronpa and Dronpa whose emission maxima are separated by <20 nm.},

abstract = {Cortical maps, consisting of orderly arrangements of functional columns,

are a hallmark of the organization of the cerebral cortex. However,

the microorganization of cortical maps at the level of single neurons

is not known, mainly because of the limitations of available mapping

techniques. Here, we used bulk loading of \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} indicators

combined with two-photon microscopy to image the activity of multiple

single neurons in layer (L) 2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex in vivo.

We developed methods that reliably detect single action potentials

in approximately half of the imaged neurons in L2/3. This allowed

us to measure the spiking probability following whisker deflection

and thus map the whisker selectivity for multiple neurons with known

spatial relationships. At the level of neuronal populations, the

whisker map varied smoothly across the surface of the cortex, within

and between the barrels. However, the whisker selectivity of individual

neurons recorded simultaneously differed greatly, even for nearest

neighbors. Trial-to-trial correlations between pairs of neurons were

high over distances spanning multiple cortical columns. Our data

suggest that the response properties of individual neurons are shaped

by highly specific subcolumnar circuits and the momentary intrinsic

state of the neocortex.},

Here we tested the hypothesis that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) synchronously applied to a motor cortex engaged in a motor training task could enhance this plastic process. Healthy volunteers were studied in four sessions: training consisting of performance of directionally specific voluntary thumb movements (Train alone), training with TMS delivered during the execution of the training movement in a strictly temporal relationship to the motor cortex contralateral (Train+TMS synchronous(contra)) and ipsilateral (Train+TMS synchronous(ipsi)) to the training hand, and training with TMS delivered asynchronous to the training movement to the motor cortex contralateral to the training hand (Train+TMS asynchronous(contra)). Train alone, Train+TMS synchronous(contra), and Train+TMS asynchronous(contra) but not Train+TMS synchronous(ipsi) elicited a clear motor memory. The longevity of the encoded memory was significantly enhanced by Train+TMS synchronous(contra) when compared with Train alone and Train+TMS asynchronous(contra). Therefore use-dependent encoding of a motor memory can be enhanced by synchronous Hebbian stimulation of the motor cortex that drives the training task and reduced by stimulation of the homologous ipsilateral motor cortex, a result relevant for studies of cognitive and physical rehabilitation.},

@article{Raphan2010,
abstract = {Selection of an optimal estimator typically relies on either supervised training samples (pairs of measurements and their associated true values) or a prior probability model for the true values. Here, we consider the problem of obtaining a least squares estimator given a measurement process with known statistics (i.e., a likelihood function) and a set of unsupervised measurements, each arising from a corresponding true value drawn randomly from an unknown distribution. We develop a general expression for a nonparametric empirical Bayes least squares (NEBLS) estimator, which expresses the optimal least squares estimator in terms of the measurement density, with no explicit reference to the unknown (prior) density. We study the conditions under which such estimators exist and derive specific forms for a variety of different measurement processes. We further show that each of these NEBLS estimators may be used to express the mean squared estimation error as an expectation over the measurement density alone, thus generalizing Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which provides such an expression for the additive gaussian noise case. This error expression may then be optimized over noisy measurement samples, in the absence of supervised training data, yielding a generalized SURE-optimized parametric least squares (SURE2PLS) estimator. In the special case of a linear parameterization (i.e., a sum of nonlinear kernel functions), the objective function is quadratic, and we derive an incremental form for learning this estimator from data. We also show that combining the NEBLS form with its corresponding generalized SURE expression produces a generalization of the score-matching procedure for parametric density estimation. Finally, we have implemented several examples of such estimators, and we show that their performance is comparable to their optimal Bayesian or supervised regression counterparts for moderate to large amounts of data.},

abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset is freely accessible at www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon\_1000/.},

abstract = {A new technique, \"{\i}¾”Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy\"{\i}¾”
(SBFSEM), allows for automatic sectioning and imaging of biological
tissue with a scanning electron microscope. Image stacks generated
with this technology have a resolution sufficient to distinguish
different cellular compartments, including synaptic structures, which
should make it possible to obtain detailed anatomical knowledge of
complete neuronal circuits. Such an image stack contains several
thousands of images and is recorded with a minimal voxel size of
10-20nm in the x and y- and 30nm in z-direction. Consequently, a
tissue block of 1mm3 17 (the approximate volume of the Calliphora
vicina brain) will produce several hundred terabytes of data. Therefore,
highly automated 3D reconstruction algorithms are needed. As a first
step in this direction we have developed semiautomated segmentation
algorithms for a precise contour tracing of cell membranes. These
algorithms were embedded into an easy-to-operate user interface,
which allows direct 3D observation of the extracted objects during
the segmentation of image stacks. Compared to purely manual tracing,
processing time is greatly accelerated.},

abstract = {We present a method for removing unwanted components of biological origin from neurophysiological recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), or multichannel electrophysiological or optical recordings. A spatial filter is designed to partition recorded activity into stimulus-related and stimulus-unrelated components, based on a criterion of stimulus-evoked reproducibility. Components that are not reproducible are projected out to obtain clean data. In experiments that measure stimulus-evoked activity, typically about 80\% of noise power is removed with minimal distortion of the evoked response. Signal-to-noise ratios of better than 0 dB (50\% reproducible power) may be obtained for the single most reproducible spatial component. The spatial filters are synthesized using a blind source separation method known as denoising source separation (DSS) that allows the measure of interest (here proportion of evoked power) to guide the source separation. That method is of greater general use, allowing data denoising beyond the classical stimulus-evoked response paradigm.},

abstract = {Lamb waves are considered a promising tool for the monitoring of plate structures. Large areas of plate structures can be monitored using active arrays employing beamforming techniques. Dispersion and multiple propagating modes are issues that need to be addressed when working with Lamb waves. Previous work has mainly focused on standard delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming while reducing the effects of multiple modes through frequency selectivity and transducer design. This paper presents a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) approach for Lamb waves using a uniform rectangular array (URA) and a single transmitter. Theoretically calculated dispersion curves are used to compensate for dispersion. The combination of the MVDR approach and the two-dimensional array improves the suppression of interfering Lamb modes. The proposed approach is evaluated on simulated and experimental data and compared with the standard DAS beamformer. It is shown that the MVDR algorithm performs better in terms of higher resolution and better side lobe and mode suppression capabilities. Known issues of the MVDR approach, such as signal cancellation in highly correlated environments and poor robustness, are addressed using methods that have proven effective for the purpose in other fields of active imaging.},

Assumption that brain functionality is specified by neuronal connectivity, implemented by costly biological wiring, leads to the following optimal design problem. For a given neuronal connectivity, find a spatial layout of neurons that minimizes the wiring cost. Unfortunately, this problem is difficult to solve because the number of possible layouts is often astronomically large. We argue that the wiring cost may scale as wire length squared, reducing the optimal layout problem to a constrained minimization of a quadratic form. For biologically plausible constraints, this problem has exact analytical solutions, which give reasonable approximations to actual layouts in the brain. These solutions make the inverse problem of inferring neuronal connectivity from neuronal layout more tractable.},

abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine whether fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain are able to reliably differentiate patients with schizophrenia from healthy volunteers. DTI and high resolution structural magnetic resonance scans were acquired in 50 patients with schizophrenia and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. FA and MD maps were estimated from the DTI data and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurologic Institute standard stereotactic space. Individuals were divided randomly into two groups of 50, a training set, and a test set, each comprising 25 patients and 25 healthy volunteers. A pattern classifier was designed using Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on the training set of images to categorize individuals in the test set as either patients or healthy volunteers. Using the FA maps, the classifier correctly identified 94\% of the cases in the test set (96\% sensitivity and 92\% specificity). The classifier achieved 98\% accuracy (96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity) when using the MD maps as inputs to distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy volunteers in the test dataset. Utilizing FA and MD data in combination did not significantly alter the accuracy (96\% sensitivity and specificity). Patterns of water self-diffusion in the brain as estimated by DTI can be used in conjunction with automated pattern recognition algorithms to reliably distinguish between patients with schizophrenia and normal control subjects.

abstract = {Many neurophysiological experiments involving monkeys require that the head be stabilized while the animal performs a task. Often a post is attached to the skull to accomplish this goal, using a headcap formed from dental acrylic. We describe a new headpost, developed by refinement of several prototypes, and supply an AutoCAD file to aid in machine shop production. This headpost is fabricated from a single piece of commercially pure titanium. It has a footplate consisting of four limbs arranged in the configuration of a "K." These are bent during surgery to match the curvature of the skull and attached with specialized titanium bone screws. Headposts were implanted in seven rhesus monkeys ranging in age from 2 yr to adult. None has been rejected after up to 17 mo of regular use. They require little or no daily toilette and create only a 0.80-cm(2) defect in the scalp. Computed tomography after implantation showed that the skull undergoes remodeling to embed the footplate in bone. This finding was confirmed by necropsy in two subjects. The outer table of the skull had grown over the titanium footplate, whereas the inner table had thickened to bury the tips of the titanium screws. The remarkable strength of the skull/implant bond was demonstrated by applying increasing amounts of torque to the headpost. At 26.3 Nm, the headpost tore from its metal footplate, but no screws came loose. The excellent performance of this implant is explained by integration of biocompatible titanium into remodeled bone tissue. The headpost is simpler to implant, more securely anchored, easier to maintain, and less obtrusive than devices attached with acrylic.},

abstract = {Near-infrared images obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope

spiral galaxy M33. AGB stars with near-infrared spectral-energy distributions
similar to those of giants in the solar neighborhood and Baade\"{\i}¾’s
Window are detected over most of the field. Neither the peak brightness
nor the color of the AGB sequence on the (K, J \^{a}ˆ’ K) color-magnitude
diagram changes with distance from the galaxy center. The bolometric
luminosity function (LF) of these stars has a discontinuity near
Mbol = \^{a}ˆ’5.25, and comparisons with evolutionary tracks suggest
that most of the AGB stars formed in a burst of star formation 1
\^{a}ˆ’ 3 Gyr in the past, indicating that the star formation rate near
the center of M33 has varied significantly during the past few Gyr.
The images are also used to investigate the integrated near-infrared
photometric properties of the nucleus and the central light concentration.
The nucleus is bluer than the central light concentration, in agreement
with previous studies at visible wavelengths. The near-infrared photometric
properties of the nucleus are reminiscent of relatively young clusters
in the Magellanic Clouds, while the photometric properties of the
central light concentration are similar to those of globular clusters.
The CO index of the central light concentration 0.5 arcsec from the
galaxy center is 0.05, which corresponds to [Fe/H] \^{a}ˆ’1.2 for simple
stellar systems. Hence, the central light concentration could not
have formed from the chemically-enriched material that dominates

abstract = {1. Single units and evoked potentials were recorded in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of paralyzed decerebrate cats in response to electrical stimulation at two sites: 1) in the somatosensory dorsal column nuclei (together called MSN below for medullary somatosensory nuclei), which activates mossy-fiber inputs to granule cells in superficial DCN, and 2) on the free surface of the DCN, which activates granule cell axons (parallel fibers) directly. The goal was to evaluate hypotheses about synaptic interactions in the cerebellum-like circuitry of the superficial DCN. A four-pulse facilitation paradigm was used (50-ms interpulse interval); this allows identification of three components of the responses of DCN principal cells (type IV units) to these stimuli. The latencies of the response components were compared with the latency of the evoked potential in DCN, which signals the arrival of the parallel fiber volley at the recording site. 2. The first component is a short-latency inhibitory response; this component is seen only with MSN stimulation and is seen almost exclusively in units also showing the second component, the transient excitatory response. The short-latency inhibitory component precedes the evoked potential. No satisfactory explanation for the short-latency component can be given at present; it most likely reflects a fast-conducting inhibitory input that arrives at the type IV unit before the slowly conducting parallel fibers. 3. The second component is a transient excitatory response; this component is seen with both MSN and parallel fiber stimulation; it is weak and appears to be masked easily by the inhibitory response components. The excitatory component occurs at the same latency as the evoked potential and probably reflects direct excitation of principal cells by granule cell axons. The excitatory component is seen in about half the type IV units for both stimulating sites. With MSN stimulation, the lack of excitation in some units suggests a heterogeneity of cochlear granule cells, with some carrying somatosensory information and some not carrying this information; with parallel fiber stimulation, excitation probably requires the stimulating and recording electrodes to be lined up on the same "beam" of parallel fibers. 4. The third component is a long-lasting inhibitory response that is observed in virtually all type IV units with both MSN and parallel-fiber stimulation; its latency is longer than the evoked potential. Evidence suggests that it is produced by inhibitory input from cartwheel cells. The appearance of this inhibitory component in almost all type IV units can be accounted for by the considerable spread of cartwheel-cell axons in the direction perpendicular to the parallel fibers. 5. The evoked potential and all three components of the unit response vary systematically in size over the four pulses of the electrical stimulus. These results can be accounted for by two phenomena: 1) a facilitation of the granule cell synapses on all cell types that produces a steadily growing response through the four pulses, resembles presynaptic facilitation, and is seen with both MSN and parallel-fiber stimulation; and 2) a strong reduction in the granule cell response between the first and second pulse for MSN stimulation only. This reduction probably occurs presynaptically in the glomerulus or in the granule cell itself and could reflect inhibitory inputs. 6. The response components described above are seen in type IV units recorded in both the fusiform-cell and deep layers of the DCN; this suggests that both pyramidal and giant cells are activated similarly. The simplest interpretation is that both principal cell types are activated by the cerebellum-like circuitry in superficial DCN. Alternatively, because giant cells appear to make limited contact with the granule-cell circuits of superficial DCN, this finding may suggest the existence of currently undescribed granule cell circuits in deep DCN that are si},

Reconstruction is useful first in quantifying how much information about the physical variables is present in the population and, second, in providing insight into how the brain might use distributed representations in solving related computational problems such as visual object recognition and spatial navigation. Two classes of reconstruction methods, namely, probabilistic or Bayesian methods and basis function methods, are discussed. They include important existing methods as special cases, such as population vector coding, optimal linear estimation, and template matching. As a representative example for the reconstruction problem, different methods were applied to multi-electrode spike train data from hippocampal place cells in freely moving rats. The reconstruction accuracy of the trajectories of the rats was compared for the different methods. Bayesian methods were especially accurate when a continuity constraint was enforced, and the best errors were within a factor of two of the information-theoretic limit on how accurate any reconstruction can be and were comparable with the intrinsic experimental errors in position tracking. In addition, the reconstruction analysis uncovered some interesting aspects of place cell activity, such as the tendency for erratic jumps of the reconstructed trajectory when the animal stopped running. In general, the theoretical values of the minimal achievable reconstruction errors quantify how accurately a physical variable is encoded in the neuronal population in the sense of mean square error, regardless of the method used for reading out the information. One related result is that the theoretical accuracy is independent of the width of the Gaussian tuning function only in two dimensions. Finally, all the reconstruction methods considered in this paper can be implemented by a unified neural network architecture, which the brain feasibly could use to solve related problems.},

abstract = {Macroscopic (millimeter scale) functional clustering is a hallmark characteristic of motor cortex spatial organization in awake behaving mammals; however, almost no information is known about the functional micro-organization (approximately 100 microm scale). Here, we optically recorded intracellular calcium transients of layer 2/3 neurons with cellular resolution over approximately 200-microm-diameter fields in the forelimb motor cortex of mobile, head-restrained mice during two distinct movements (running and grooming). We showed that the temporal correlation between neurons was statistically larger the closer the neurons were to each other. We further explored this correlation by using two separate methods to spatially segment the neurons within each imaging field: K-means clustering and correlations between single neuron activity and mouse movements. The two methods segmented the neurons similarly and led to the conclusion that the origin of the inverse relationship between correlation and distance seen statistically was twofold: clusters of highly temporally correlated neurons were often spatially distinct from one another, and (even when the clusters were spatially intermingled) within the clusters, the more correlated the neurons were to each other, the shorter the distance between them. Our results represent a direct observation of functional clustering within the microcircuitry of the awake mouse motor cortex.},

@article{Truccolo2005b,
abstract = {Multiple factors simultaneously affect the spiking activity of individual neurons. Determining the effects and relative importance of these factors is a challenging problem in neurophysiology. We propose a statistical framework based on the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to three typical covariates: the neuron's own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and extrinsic covariates such as stimuli or behavior. The framework uses parametric models of the conditional intensity function to define a neuron's spiking probability in terms of the covariates. The discrete time likelihood function for point processes is used to carry out model fitting and model analysis. We show that, by modeling the logarithm of the conditional intensity function as a linear combination of functions of the covariates, the discrete time point process likelihood function is readily analyzed in the generalized linear model (GLM) framework. We illustrate our approach for both GLM and non-GLM likelihood functions using simulated data and multivariate single-unit activity data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of a monkey performing a visuomotor pursuit-tracking task. The point process framework provides a flexible, computationally efficient approach for maximum likelihood estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, residual analysis, model selection, and neural decoding. The framework thus allows for the formulation and analysis of point process models of neural spiking activity that readily capture the simultaneous effects of multiple covariates and enables the assessment of their relative importance.},

significance of the segmentation is unknown. In zebrafish, the hindbrain

activity of one set of individually identified, serially homologous

behavior. Behavioral studies predicted that differential activity

in this set of serially homologous neurons might serve to control

the directionality of the escape behavior that fish use to avoid

predators. We found that the serially homologous cells are indeed

activated during escapes and that the combination of cells activated

depends upon the location of the sensory stimulus used to elicit

the escape. The patterns of activation we observed were exactly those

predicted by behavioral studies. The data suggest that duplication

of ancestral hindbrain segments, and subsequent functional diversification,

resulted in sets of related neurons whose activity patterns create

behavioral variability.},

abstract = {A computational model of the neural circuitry of the gerbil dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), based on the MacGregor's neuromime model, was used to simulate type III unit (P-cell) responses to notch noise stimuli. The DCN patch model is based on a previous computational model of the cat DCN [Hancock, K. E., and H. F. Voigt. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 27:73-87, 1999]. According to the experimental study of Parsons et al. [Ann. Biomed. Eng. 29:887-896, 2001], the responses of gerbil DCN type III units to notch noise stimuli are similar to those of cat DCN type IV units, which are thought to be spectral notch detectors. This suggests that type III units in the gerbil DCN may serve as spectral notch detectors. In this modeling study, a simplified notch noise response plot-spike discharge rate vs. notch cutoff frequency plot-was used to compare model responses to the experimental results. Parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis of three connection parameters within the DCN patch have been studied and shows the model is robust, providing reasonable fits to the experimental data from 14 of 15 type III units examined [work supported by a grant from NIDCD, Boston University's Biomedical Engineering department and Hearing Research Center].},

An example context concerns common biological studies using high-throughput technologies generating many, very large datasets and requiring increasingly high-dimensional mixture models with large numbers of mixture components. We outline important strategies and processes for GPU computation in Bayesian simulation and optimization approaches, give examples of the benefits of GPU implementations in terms of processing speed and scale-up in ability to analyze large datasets, and provide a detailed, tutorial-style exposition that will benefit readers interested in developing GPU-based approaches in other statistical models. Novel, GPU-oriented approaches to modifying existing algorithms software design can lead to vast speed-up and, critically, enable statistical analyses that presently will not be performed due to compute time limitations in traditional computational environments. Supplemental materials are provided with all source code, example data, and details that will enable readers to implement and explore the GPU approach in this mixture modeling context.},

Here we combined a local superfusion technique with two-photon imaging, which allowed us to scrutinize specific regions of the postsynaptic dendrite where we knew that the synaptic changes had to occur. We show that after induction of long-lasting (but not short-lasting) functional enhancement of synapses in area CA1, new spines appear on the postsynaptic dendrite, whereas in control regions on the same dendrite or in slices where long-term potentiation was blocked, no significant spine growth occurred.},

With a dense multi-electrode array, each ganglion cell produces a unique pattern of activity on many electrodes when it fires an action potential. Signals from all of the electrodes are combined with an iterative spike sorting algorithm to resolve ambiguities arising from overlapping spike waveforms. We verify that we are recording from a large fraction of ganglion cells over the array by labeling the ganglion cells with a retrogradely transported dye and by comparing the number of labeled and recorded cells. Using these methods, we show that about 60 receptive fields of ganglion cells cover each point in visual space in the salamander, consistent with anatomical findings.},

We have tested this hypothesis by generating and analyzing a genetically engineered mouse strain in which the N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptor gene is ablated specifically in the CA3 pyramidal cells of adult mice. The mutant mice normally acquired and retrieved spatial reference memory in the Morris water maze, but they were impaired in retrieving this memory when presented with a fraction of the original cues. Similarly, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in mutant mice displayed normal place-related activity in a full-cue environment but showed a reduction in activity upon partial cue removal.

All these factors make accurate tracking over long trajectories difficult and hence there is still a pressing need to develop better algorithms to extract the maximum information from a sequence of fluorescence images. We describe here a Bayesian-based inference approach, based on a trans-dimensional sequential Monte Carlo method that utilizes both the spatial and temporal information present in the image sequences. We show, using model data, where the real trajectory of the molecule is known, that our method allows accurate tracking of molecules over long trajectories even with low signal/noise ratio and in the presence of fluorescence blinking and photobleaching. The method is then applied to real experimental data.},

The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron's response variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron's output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an objective function that minimizes response variability and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena, including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic efficacy increases. We compare our account to other efforts to derive STDP from computational principles and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of unsupervised cortical adaptation.},

abstract = {Traditional studies of neuroanatomical connections require injection of tracer compounds into living brains, then histology of the postmortem tissue. Here, we describe and validate a compound that reveals neuronal connections in vivo, using MRI. The classic anatomical tracer CTB (cholera-toxin subunit-B) was conjugated with a gadolinium-chelate to form GdDOTA-CTB. GdDOTA-CTB was injected into the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) or the olfactory pathway of rats. High-resolution MR images were collected at a range of time points at 11.7T and 7T. The transported GdDOTA-CTB was visible for at least 1 month post-injection, clearing within 2 months. Control injections of non-conjugated GdDOTA into S1 were not transported and cleared within 1-2 days. Control injections of Gd-Albumin were not transported either, clearing within 7 days. These MR results were verified by classic immunohistochemical staining for CTB, in the same animals. The GdDOTA-CTB neuronal transport was target specific, monosynaptic, stable for several weeks, and reproducible.},

abstract = {The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue-green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of 'optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

abstract = {Typically in neuroimaging we are looking to extract some pertinent information from imperfect, noisy images of the brain. This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors. It allows us to extract probabilistic information from the data, and to probabilistically combine information from multiple modalities. Bayes can also be used to not only compare and select between models of different complexity, but also to infer on data using committees of models. Finally, we mention some analysis scenarios where Bayesian methods are impractical, and briefly discuss some practical approaches that we have taken in these cases.},

abstract = {Although plastic changes are known to occur in developing and adult

cortex, it remains unclear whether these changes require remodeling

of cortical circuitry whereby synapses are formed and eliminated

or whether they rely on changes in the strength of existing synapses.

To determine the structural stability of dendritic spines and axon

terminals in vivo, we chose two approaches. First, we performed time-lapse

two-photon imaging of dendritic spine motility of layer 5 pyramidal

neurons in juvenile [postnatal day 28 (P28)] mice in visual, auditory,

and somatosensory cortices. We found that there were differences

in basal rates of dendritic spine motility of the same neuron type

in different cortices, with visual cortex exhibiting the least structural

dynamics. Rewiring visual input into the auditory cortex at birth,

however, failed to alter dendritic spine motility, suggesting that

structural plasticity rates might be intrinsic to the cortical region.

Second, we investigated the persistence of both the presynaptic (axon

terminals) and postsynaptic (dendritic spine) structures in young

adult mice (P40-P61), using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in

different sensory areas. Both terminals and spines were relatively

stable, with >80\% persisting over a 3 week period in all sensory

regions. Axon terminals were more stable than dendritic spines. These

data suggest that changes in network function during adult learning

and memory might occur through changes in the strength and efficacy

of existing synapses as well as some remodeling of connectivity through

the loss and gain of synapses.},

G-protein activity was measured as a [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay

effect was clearly biphasic--a decrease in the activity was followed
by an activation maximum and finally, at high concentrations, drastic
inhibition of the G-protein activity was noticed. Contrarily, specific
radioligand binding to GABAB-receptor was inhibited in the whole
range of detergent concentrations step by step, i.e. it was strictly
monophasic. The magnitude of both detergent effects was decreased
in the same order of potency: Brij58>Triton X-100>Digitonin. The
identical order was found when comparing detergents ability to alter
fluorescence anisotropy of the membrane probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene
(rDPH) incorporated into the hydrophobic PM interior. Decrease of
rDPH, in the order of Brij58>Triton X-100>Digitonin, was reflected
as decrease of the S-order parameter and rotation correlation time
phi paralleled by an increase of diffusion wobbling constant Dw (analysis
by time-resolved fluorescence according to "wobble-in-cone" model).
The influence of the detergents on the membrane organization at the
polar headgroup region was characterized by Laurdan generalized polarization
(GP). As before, the effect of detergents on GP parameters proceeded

@article{Svoboda2008i,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estrogen exposure is a risk factor for gallstone disease
(cholelithiasis), which often leads to chronic inflammation (cholecystitis).
Studies in various estrogen-sensitive tissues showed that key enzymes
involved in the inactivation and activation of estrogens as well
as expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta determine the
amount of active estrogen. In estrogen-sensitive tissues, e.g. the
female breast, estrone sulfate (E1S), present at high concentrations
in the circulation, is converted into the biologically active estrone
(E1) by steroid sulfatase (STS) and again reverted into E1S by estrogen
sulfotransferase (SULT1E1) providing a local estrogen storage. AIMS:
To assess whether this might also apply for gallbladder epithelia,
we determined expression of these two enzymes and of ERalpha and
ERbeta in 15 cholelithiasis specimens from tissues with/or without
inflammation. METHODS: Quantitative (Real-time) PCR and immunofluorescence
were used as methods. RESULTS: We demonstrate mRNA expression of
SULT1E1, STS, and ERalpha in all specimens with mean enrichment of
3.53- vs. 1.72-fold (n.s.), 3.5- vs. 0.91-fold (n.s.), and 3.04-
vs. 1.6-fold (n.s.) in the inflammatory and non-inflammatory groups,
respectively. Although high expression levels were seen in many specimens
(means 4.88-fold vs. 5.77-fold), ERbeta mRNA was below the detection
limit in two specimens from cholecystitis patients. To further investigate
this varying expression pattern of ERbeta, immunohistological studies
were performed, which indeed showed low expression levels of ERbeta
in the damaged mucosa, while in specimens with well preserved mucosa,
high ERbeta levels were seen in the cytosol and in the nucleus. CONCLUSION:
The data show expression of an estrogen network of activating STS
and inactivating SULT1E1. Together with ERalpha and ERbeta, these
enzymes could regulate estrogen concentrations in human gallbladder.},

However, the underlying mechanisms for the apparent differences in cognitive processing styles have not been known. In the present study, we examined the possibility that the cultural differences arise from culturally different viewing patterns when confronted with a naturalistic scene. We measured the eye movements of American and Chinese participants while they viewed photographs with a focal object on a complex background. In fact, the Americans fixated more on focal objects than did the Chinese, and the Americans tended to look at the focal object more quickly. In addition, the Chinese made more saccades to the background than did the Americans. Thus, it appears that differences in judgment and memory may have their origins in differences in what is actually attended as people view a scene.},

abstract = {Sleep affects learning and development in humans and other animals, but the role of sleep in developmental learning has never been examined. Here we show the effects of night-sleep on song development in the zebra finch by recording and analysing the entire song ontogeny. During periods of rapid learning we observed a pronounced deterioration in song structure after night-sleep. The song regained structure after intense morning singing. Daily improvement in similarity to the tutored song occurred during the late phase of this morning recovery; little further improvement occurred thereafter. Furthermore, birds that showed stronger post-sleep deterioration during development achieved a better final imitation. The effect diminished with age. Our experiments showed that these oscillations were not a result of sleep inertia or lack of practice, indicating the possible involvement of an active process, perhaps neural song-replay during sleep. We suggest that these oscillations correspond to competing demands of plasticity and consolidation during learning, creating repeated opportunities to reshape previously learned motor skills.},

abstract = {Physiological studies of visual attention have demonstrated that focusing attention near a visual cortical neuron's receptive field (RF) results in enhanced evoked activity and RF shift. In this work, we explored the mechanisms of attention induced RF shifts in cortical network models that receive an attentional 'spotlight'. Our main results are threefold. First, whereas a 'spotlight' input always produces toward-attention shift of the population activity profile, we found that toward-attention shifts in RFs of single cells requires multiplicative gain modulation. Secondly, in a feedforward two-layer model, focal attentional gain modulation in first-layer neurons induces RF shift in second-layer neurons downstream. In contrast to experimental observations, the feedforward model typically fails to produce RF shifts in second-layer neurons when attention is directed beyond RF boundaries. We then show that an additive spotlight input combined with a recurrent network mechanism can produce the observed RF shift. Inhibitory effects in a surround of the attentional focus accentuate this RF shift and induce RF shrinking. Thirdly, we considered interrelationship between visual selective attention and adaptation. Our analysis predicts that the RF size is enlarged (respectively reduced) by attentional signal directed near a cell's RF center in a recurrent network (resp. in a feedforward network); the opposite is true for visual adaptation. Therefore, a refined estimation of the RF size during attention and after adaptation would provide a probe to differentiate recurrent versus feedforward mechanisms for RF shifts.},

We have used advances in axon labeling by viruses and in vivo two-photon microscopy to investigate axon branching and bouton dynamics in primary visual cortex (V1) of adult Macaque monkeys. A nonreplicative adeno-associated virus bearing the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (AAV.EGFP) provided persistent labeling of axons, and a custom-designed two-photon microscope enabled repeated imaging of the intact brain over several weeks. We found that large-scale branching patterns were stable but that a subset of small branches associated with terminaux boutons, as well as a subset of en passant boutons, appeared and disappeared every week. Bouton losses and gains were both approximately 7\% of the total population per week, with no net change in the overall density. These results suggest ongoing processes of synaptogenesis and elimination in adult V1.},

abstract = {Morphological characteristics of non-pyramidal neurons in the guinea
pig hippocampus (regions CA1 and CA3) were analyzed by a correlated
light and electron microscopic approach. Following Golgi impregnation,
the cells were first studied under the light microscope and classified
according to the location of their cell bodies and the distribution
of their dendrites in the different hippocampal layers. Next, the
Golgi impregnated non-pyramidal neurons were gold-toned and deimpregnated,
allowing an electron microscopic analysis of the identified structures.
With regard to cell body location and dendritic pattern, non-pyramidal
cells are a rather heterogeneous group of neurons. Their perikarya
were found in all hippocampal layers and their dendrites had a less
regular orientation when compared to pyramidal neurons and granule
cells. Two basic types, i.e., "vertical" and "horizontal" non-pyramidal
neurons are described. Many cells were of an intermediate type with
dendrites extending in all directions. Non-pyramidal cell dendrites
were mostly devoid of spines but exhibited numerous varicosities.
Non-pyramidal cell axons could sometimes be seen extending towards
the pyramidal cell layer. A surprising uniformity was observed when
the impregnated, identified non-pyramidal neurons were studied in
the electron microscope. Their perikarya exhibited a well-developed
endoplasmic reticulum and indented nuclei. Both the cell bodies and
the varicose dendrites were densely covered with synaptic boutons
which mainly formed asymmetric synaptic contacts. Only occasionally
were symmetric synaptic contacts observed. Non-pyramidal cell dendrites
extending into the stratum lucidum of CA3 were found to be contacted
by the giant boutons of mossy fiber axons. In addition to synaptic
contacts, the dendrites of gold-toned non-pyramidal neurons formed
gap junctions with neighboring dendrites. The results are discussed
in relation to recent immunocytochemical studies which have shown
non-pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus to contain gamma-aminobutyric
acid and/or various neuropeptides.},

@article{Lenoir2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refined sugars (e.g., sucrose, fructose) were absent in the diet of most people until very recently in human history. Today overconsumption of diets rich in sugars contributes together with other factors to drive the current obesity epidemic. Overconsumption of sugar-dense foods or beverages is initially motivated by the pleasure of sweet taste and is often compared to drug addiction. Though there are many biological commonalities between sweetened diets and drugs of abuse, the addictive potential of the former relative to the latter is currently unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report that when rats were allowed to choose mutually-exclusively between water sweetened with saccharin-an intense calorie-free sweetener-and intravenous cocaine-a highly addictive and harmful substance-the large majority of animals (94\%) preferred the sweet taste of saccharin. The preference for saccharin was not attributable to its unnatural ability to induce sweetness without calories because the same preference was also observed with sucrose, a natural sugar. Finally, the preference for saccharin was not surmountable by increasing doses of cocaine and was observed despite either cocaine intoxication, sensitization or intake escalation-the latter being a hallmark of drug addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings clearly demonstrate that intense sweetness can surpass cocaine reward, even in drug-sensitized and -addicted individuals. We speculate that the addictive potential of intense sweetness results from an inborn hypersensitivity to sweet tastants. In most mammals, including rats and humans, sweet receptors evolved in ancestral environments poor in sugars and are thus not adapted to high concentrations of sweet tastants. The supranormal stimulation of these receptors by sugar-rich diets, such as those now widely available in modern societies, would generate a supranormal reward signal in the brain, with the potential to override self-control mechanisms and thus to lead to addiction.},

abstract = {Multiple factors simultaneously affect the spiking activity of individual neurons. Determining the effects and relative importance of these factors is a challenging problem in neurophysiology. We propose a statistical framework based on the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to three typical covariates: the neuron's own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and extrinsic covariates such as stimuli or behavior. The framework uses parametric models of the conditional intensity function to define a neuron's spiking probability in terms of the covariates. The discrete time likelihood function for point processes is used to carry out model fitting and model analysis. We show that, by modeling the logarithm of the conditional intensity function as a linear combination of functions of the covariates, the discrete time point process likelihood function is readily analyzed in the generalized linear model (GLM) framework. We illustrate our approach for both GLM and non-GLM likelihood functions using simulated data and multivariate single-unit activity data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of a monkey performing a visuomotor pursuit-tracking task. The point process framework provides a flexible, computationally efficient approach for maximum likelihood estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, residual analysis, model selection, and neural decoding. The framework thus allows for the formulation and analysis of point process models of neural spiking activity that readily capture the simultaneous effects of multiple covariates and enables the assessment of their relative importance.},

The prevailing view has been that information processing in neural networks results primarily from the properties of synapses and the connectivity of neurons within the network, with the intrinsic excitability of single neurons playing a lesser role. As a consequence, the contribution of single neurons to computation in the brain has long been underestimated. Here we review recent work showing that neuronal dendrites exhibit a range of linear and nonlinear mechanisms that allow them to implement elementary computations. We discuss why these dendritic properties may be essential for the computations performed by the neuron and the network and provide theoretical and experimental examples to support this view.},

METHODS: The fronto-orbital fracture was divided into two types according to whether there were any large scale fronto-orbital bone defects: type I: Large scale fronto-orbital bone defect; type II: Concave fronto-orbital fracture deformity without large scale bone defect. Both types were treated through intro-extra cranial approach to expose the fracture site. For type I deformity, the bone defects were repaired and reconstructed with outer table of cranial bone and artificial bone. For type II, the deformity was repaired by osteotomy, bone reposition and internal rigid fixation. RESULTS: 18 cases were treated from June 1998 to October 2000, include type I, 12 cases, and type II, 6 cases. All the patients recovered well and the post-operative appearance were greatly improved. CONCLUSIONS: Intro-extra cranial approach can expose the fractured site better than the simple extrocranio approach, and make the operation more easily done. Combined with the technique of cranio maxillo facial surgery, the treatment can be more complete and the results can be more satisfactory.},

We propose a new feature-selection algorithm that addresses several major issues with prior work, including problems with algorithm implementation, computational complexity, and solution accuracy. The key idea is to decompose an arbitrarily complex nonlinear problem into a set of locally linear ones through local learning, and then learn feature relevance globally within the large margin framework. The proposed algorithm is based on well-established machine learning and numerical analysis techniques, without making any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. It is capable of processing many thousands of features within minutes on a personal computer while maintaining a very high accuracy that is nearly insensitive to a growing number of irrelevant features. Theoretical analyses of the algorithm's sample complexity suggest that the algorithm has a logarithmical sample complexity with respect to the number of features. Experiments on 11 synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the viability of our formulation of the feature-selection problem for supervised learning and the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

abstract = {We describe a class of models that predict how the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron depends on a dynamic stimulus. The models utilize a learnt pointwise nonlinear transform of the stimulus, followed by a linear filter that acts on the sequence of transformed inputs. In one case, the nonlinear transform is the same at all filter lag-times. Thus, this "input nonlinearity" converts the initial numerical representation of stimulus value to a new representation that provides optimal input to the subsequent linear model. We describe algorithms that estimate both the input nonlinearity and the linear weights simultaneously; and present techniques to regularise and quantify uncertainty in the estimates. In a second approach, the model is generalized to allow a different nonlinear transform of the stimulus value at each lag-time. Although more general, this model is algorithmically more straightforward to fit. However, it has many more degrees of freedom than the first approach, thus requiring more data for accurate estimation. We test the feasibility of these methods on synthetic data, and on responses from a neuron in rodent barrel cortex. The models are shown to predict responses to novel data accurately, and to recover several important neuronal response properties.},

the rat neocortex. An analysis of 3D reconstructions of pairs consisting
of pyramidal cells (PCs) and GABAergic interneurons (GIs) revealed
that the layout of GI axons is specific. This specificity is manifested
in a relatively high tortuosity, small branch length of these axons,
and correlations of their trajectories with the positions of postsynaptic
neuron dendrites. Axons of PCs show no such specificity, usually
taking a relatively straight course through neuropil. However, wiring
patterns among PCs hold a large potential for circuit remodeling
and specificity through growth and retraction of dendritic spines.
Our results define distinct class-specific rules in establishing
synaptic connectivity, which could be crucial in formulating a canonical

Receptive fields are thought to provide a representation of sensory experience from which the cerebral cortex may make interpretations. While it is essential to determine a neuron's receptive field, it remains unclear which features of the acoustic environment are specifically represented by neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI). We characterized cat AI spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) by finding both the spike-triggered average (STA) and stimulus dimensions that maximized the mutual information between response and stimulus. We derived a nonlinearity relating spiking to stimulus projection onto two maximally informative dimensions (MIDs). The STA was highly correlated with the first MID. Generally, the nonlinearity for the first MID was asymmetric and often monotonic in shape, while the second MID nonlinearity was symmetric and nonmonotonic. The joint nonlinearity for both MIDs revealed that most first and second MIDs were synergistic and thus should be considered conjointly. The difference between the nonlinearities suggests different possible roles for the MIDs in auditory processing.},

@article{Wythe2001,
abstract = {Strong lensing is a powerful probe of the distribution of matter in
the cores of clusters of galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the
cold dark matter model predicts cores that are denser than those
observed in galaxies, groups, and clusters. One possible resolution
of the discrepancy is that the dark matter has strong interactions
(SIDM), which leads to lower central densities. A generalized form
of the Navarro, Frenk, \& White profile (Zhao profile) can be used
to describe these halos. In this paper we examine gravitational lensing
statistics for this class of model. The optical depth to multiple
imaging is a very sensitive function of the profile parameters in
the range of interest for SIDM halos around clusters of galaxies.
Less concentrated profiles, which result from larger self-interaction
cross sections, can produce many fewer lensed pairs. Furthermore,
profiles that result in a small optical depth exhibit reduced typical
splittings, but produce multiple images that are more highly magnified.
However, the resulting increased magnification bias does not alter
our conclusions. We find that lensing statistics based on profile
parameters obtained from fits out to the virial radius are dependent
on the minimization scheme adopted, and may be seriously in error.
However, profile fits weighted toward the core region have parameter
degeneracies that are approximately equivalent to those for strong-lensing
cross sections. Lensing statistics provide a powerful test for SIDM.
More realistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to
be done; however, larger self-interaction cross sections may well
be ruled out by the very existence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster
scales. The inclusion of centrally dominant cluster galaxies should
boost the cross section to multiple imaging. However, our preliminary
calculations suggest that the additional multiple imaging rate is
small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate for
different halo profiles. In future statistical studies, it will be
important to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles,
since the optical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most
concentrated members of a cluster population.},

computation of local bifurcations using computer algebra reveals
conditions for the local asymptotic stability of steady states and
provides certain insights on the global dynamics of the system. The

These characteristics include a sustained depolarized membrane potential (V(m)) and irregular firing activity. In the present paper, we evaluate our understanding of cortical activated states from a computational neuroscience point of view. We start by reviewing the electrophysiological characteristics of activated cortical states based on recordings and analysis performed in awake cat association cortex. These analyses show that cortical activity is characterized by an apparent Poisson-distributed stochastic dynamics, both at the single-cell and population levels, and that single cells display a high-conductance state dominated by inhibition. We next overview computational models of the "awake" cortex, and perform the same analyses as in the experiments. Many properties identified experimentally are indeed reproduced by models, such as depolarized V(m), irregular firing with apparent Poisson statistics, and the determinant role of inhibitory fluctuations on spiking. However, other features are not well reproduced, such as firing statistics and the conductance state of the membrane, suggesting that the network state displayed by models is not entirely correct. We also show how networks can approach a correct conductance state, suggesting ways by which future models will generate activity fully consistent with experimental data.},

abstract = {Simultaneous extracellular recordings from one electrode of 'local' groups of 3-6 neurons were obtained from the auditory cortex of unanesthetized, paralyzed cats. The activity and functional connectivity of local microenvironments were examined under various auditory stimuli. Single cell response patterns were examined using peri-stimulus (PST) histograms and functional connectivity among neighboring cells by the cross renewal density (CRD) histograms. Analysis of the PST histograms suggested that a high percentage of single cells demonstrated different response patterns to different stimuli. Analysis of the CRD histograms suggested, on the one hand, that only small numbers of neighboring cells behaved as if there were direct connections from one cell to another, and that these direct connections appeared to be excitatory. On the other hand, many cell pairs shared input from shared sources which lay outside the local groups. The majority of functional connections were altered by at least one of the stimuli delivered, thus demonstrating the system's plasticity. It is suggested that long-term gates at the synaptic level are responsible for this phenomenon.},

abstract = {Current multielectrode techniques enable the simultaneous recording of spikes from hundreds of neurons. To study neural plasticity and network structure it is desirable to infer the underlying functional connectivity between the recorded neurons. Functional connectivity is defined by a large number of parameters, which characterize how each neuron influences the other neurons. A Bayesian approach that combines information from the recorded spikes (likelihood) with prior beliefs about functional connectivity (prior) can improve inference of these parameters and reduce overfitting. Recent studies have used likelihood functions based on the statistics of point-processes and a prior that captures the sparseness of neural connections. Here we include a prior that captures the empirical finding that interactions tend to vary smoothly in time. We show that this method can successfully infer connectivity patterns in simulated data and apply the algorithm to spike data recorded from primary motor (M1) and premotor (PMd) cortices of a monkey. Finally, we present a new approach to studying structure in inferred connections based on a Bayesian clustering algorithm. Groups of neurons in M1 and PMd show common patterns of input and output that may correspond to functional assemblies.},

The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to approximately 2-5 microm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of <5\%.},

typically very large compactness parameter, \^{I}º = L/LEdd*Rg/R\^{a}‰¥ 0.01,
given that in most cases the accretion disks within 10 Schwarzschild
radii Rg radiate with a power exceeding 10 percent of the Eddington

these objects (both of stellar mass and super-massive BHs) is generally
suppressed, and consequently the unique information on possible particle
acceleration processes near the event horizon of the BH is essentially
lost. Fortunately this is not the case for the super-massive BH located
at the dynamical center of our Galaxy (Sgr A*), which thanks to its
extraordinary low bolometric luminosity (\^{a}‰¤ 10\^{a}ˆ’8LEdd) is transparent

different scenarios of gamma-ray production in Sgr A*, and show that

from the direction of Galactic Center, but may have broader implications

abstract = {Speech is the most interesting and one of the most complex sounds dealt with by the auditory system. The neural representation of speech needs to capture those features of the signal on which the brain depends in language communication. Here we describe the representation of speech in the auditory nerve and in a few sites in the central nervous system from the perspective of the neural coding of important aspects of the signal. The representation is tonotopic, meaning that the speech signal is decomposed by frequency and different frequency components are represented in different populations of neurons. Essential to the representation are the properties of frequency tuning and nonlinear suppression. Tuning creates the decomposition of the signal by frequency, and nonlinear suppression is essential for maintaining the representation across sound levels. The representation changes in central auditory neurons by becoming more robust against changes in stimulus intensity and more transient. However, it is probable that the form of the representation at the auditory cortex is fundamentally different from that at lower levels, in that stimulus features other than the distribution of energy across frequency are analysed.},

White matter tractography using sequential importance sampling. In: Proceedings of the ISMRM Annual Meeting, p. 1131] and Bjornemo et al. [Bjornemo, M., Brun, A., Kikinis, R., Westin, C.F., 2002. Regularized stochastic white matter tractography using diffusion tensor MRI, In: Proc. MICCAI, pp. 435-442]. However, these previous attempts have not utilised the full power of the technique, and as a result the fiber paths were tracked in a goal directed way. In this paper, we provide an advanced technique by presenting a fast and novel probabilistic method for white matter fiber tracking in diffusion weighted MRI (DWI), which takes advantage of the weighting and resampling mechanism of particle filtering. We formulate fiber tracking using a non-linear state space model which captures both smoothness regularity of the fibers and the uncertainties in the local fiber orientations due to noise and partial volume effects. Global fiber tracking is then posed as a problem of particle filtering. To model the posterior distribution, we classify voxels of the white matter as either prolate or oblate tensors. We then construct the orientation distributions for prolate and oblate tensors separately. Finally, the importance density function for particle filtering is modeled using the von Mises-Fisher distribution on a unit sphere. Fast and efficient sampling is achieved using Ulrich-Wood's simulation algorithm. Given a seed point, the method is able to rapidly locate the globally optimal fiber and also provides a probability map for potential connections. The proposed method is validated and compared to alternative methods both on synthetic data and real-world brain MRI datasets.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can provide information related to the arrangement of white matter fibers. The diffusion tensor is the model most commonly used to derive the orientation of the fibers within a voxel. However, this model has been shown to fail in regions containing several fiber populations with distinct orientations. A number of alternative models have been suggested, such as multiple tensor fitting, q-space, and Q-ball imaging. However, each of these has inherent limitations. In this study, we propose a novel method for estimating the fiber orientation distribution directly from high angular resolution diffusion-weighted MR data without the need for prior assumptions regarding the number of fiber populations present. We assume that all white matter fiber bundles in the brain share identical diffusion characteristics, thus implicitly assigning any differences in diffusion anisotropy to partial volume effects. The diffusion-weighted signal attenuation measured over the surface of a sphere can then be expressed as the convolution over the sphere of a response function (the diffusion-weighted attenuation profile for a typical fiber bundle) with the fiber orientation density function (ODF). The fiber ODF (the distribution of fiber orientations within the voxel) can therefore be obtained using spherical deconvolution. The properties of the technique are demonstrated using simulations and on data acquired from a volunteer using a standard 1.5-T clinical scanner. The technique can recover the fiber ODF in regions of multiple fiber crossing and holds promise for applications such as tractography.},

abstract = {Detection of interaural time differences underlies azimuthal sound localization in the barn owl Tyto alba. Axons of the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis, and their targets in the binaural nucleus laminaris, form the circuit responsible for encoding these interaural time differences. The nucleus laminaris receives bilateral inputs from the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis such that axons from the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus enter the nucleus laminaris dorsally, while contralateral axons enter from the ventral side. This interdigitating projection to the nucleus laminaris is tonotopic, and the afferents are both sharply tuned and matched in frequency to the neighboring afferents. Recordings of phase-locked spikes in the afferents show an orderly change in the arrival time of the spikes as a function of distance from the point of their entry into the nucleus laminaris. The same range of conduction time (160 mu sec) was found over the 700-mu m depth of the nucleus laminaris for all frequencies examined (4-7.5 kHz) and corresponds to the range of interaural time differences available to the barn owl. The estimated conduction velocity in the axons is low (3-5 m/sec) and may be regulated by short internodal distances (60 mu m) within the nucleus laminaris. Neurons of the nucleus laminaris have large somata and very short dendrites. These cells are frequency selective and phase-lock to both monaural and binaural stimuli. The arrival time of phase-locked spikes in many of these neurons differs between the ipsilateral and contralateral inputs. When this disparity is nullified by imposition of an appropriate interaural time difference, the neurons respond maximally. The number of spikes elicited in response to a favorable interaural time difference is roughly double that elicited by a monaural stimulus. Spike counts for unfavorable interaural time differences fall well below monaural response levels. These findings indicate that the magnocellular afferents work as delay lines, and the laminaris neurons work as co-incidence detectors. The orderly distribution of conduction times, the predictability of favorable interaural time differences from monaural phase responses, and the pattern of the anatomical projection from the nucleus laminaris to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus suggest that interaural time differences and their phase equivalents are mapped in each frequency band along the dorsoventral axis of the nucleus laminaris.},

abstract = {Cochlear damage can change the spontaneous firing rates of neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Increased spontaneous firing rates (hyperactivity) after acoustic trauma have been observed in the DCN of rodents such as hamsters, chinchillas and rats. This hyperactivity has been interpreted as a neural correlate of tinnitus. In cats, however, the spontaneous firing rates of DCN neurons were not significantly elevated after acoustic trauma. Species-specific spontaneous firing rates after cochlear damage might be attributable to differences in the response types of DCN neurons: In gerbils, type III response characteristics are predominant, whereas in cats type IV responses are more frequent. To address the question of how the development of hyperactivity after cochlear damage depends on the response type of DCN neurons, we use a computational model of the basic circuit of the DCN. By changing the strength of two types of inhibition, we can reproduce salient features of the responses of DCN neurons. Simulated cochlear damage, which decreases the activity of auditory nerve fibers, is assumed to activate homeostatic plasticity in projection neurons (PNs) of the DCN. We find that the resulting spontaneous firing rates depend on the response type of DCN PNs: PNs with type III and type IV-T response characteristics may become hyperactive, whereas type IV PNs do not develop increased spontaneous firing rates after acoustic trauma. This theoretical framework for the mechanisms and circumstances of the development of hyperactivity in central auditory neurons might also provide new insights into the development of tinnitus.},

abstract = {Multipolar cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) are a structurally

and functionally diverse group of projection neurons. Understanding

their role in the ascending pathway involves partitioning multipolar

cells into distinct populations and determining where in the brain

each sends its coded messages. In this study, we used retrograde

labeling techniques in rats to identify multipolar neurons that project

their axons to the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), the

contralateral CN, or both structures. Three rats received injections

of biotinylated dextran amine in the ipsilateral DCN and diamidino

yellow in the contralateral CN. Several radiate multipolar neurons

(defined by their axonal projections to the ipsilateral DCN and their

dendrites that traverse VCN isofrequency sheets) were double-labeled

but over 70\% were not. This result suggests two distinct populations:

(1) radiate-commissural (RC) multipolar cells that project to the

ipsilateral DCN and the contralateral CN, and (2) radiate multipolar

cells that project exclusively (in this context) to the ipsilateral

DCN. In a different group of animals, we retrogradely labeled multipolar

neurons that project their axons to the contralateral CN and measured

the size of their cell bodies. The mean size of this population (266

+/- 156 microm2) was significantly smaller than those of RC-multipolar

cells (418 +/- 140 microm2). We conclude that the CN commissural

pathway is composed of at least two components: (1) RC multipolar

cells and (2) commissural multipolar cells that are small- and medium-sized

neurons that project exclusively (in this context) to the contralateral

CN. These results identify separate structural groups of multipolar

cells that may correspond to physiological unit types described in

the literature. They also provide protocols for isolating and studying

different populations of multipolar cells to determine the neural

mechanisms that govern their responses to sound.},

abstract = {An increasing number of laboratories are studying population properties of the nervous system using data where the spike activity of more than one neuron is recorded on each electrode and where, accidentally or deliberately, these activities are not resolved into single unit spike trains. We have previously examined the consequences for measurement of cross-correlation between two such electrodes in the limited case where all individual distant (between electrode) correlations are the same and all individual close (on a single electrode) correlations are the same [Bedenbaugh, P.H., and Gerstein, G.L. (1997). Multiunit normalized cross correlation differs from the average single-unit normalized correlation. Neural Computation 9, 1265-1275]. Here, we lift these unrealistic restrictions to allow all values of individual correlation, and examine explicitly the cases of two or three unresolved neurons on each electrode. In these situations, the cross-correlation coefficient measured between the electrodes is a linear sum of the distant correlations, divided by a non-linear function of the close correlations. We then examine in detail the case of a single direct distant correlation and take account of all relevant indirect correlations. The measured interelectrode correlation shows a reduction of this actual distant correlation by a non-linear function of the close correlations on each electrode over most of their possible values. Finally, we examine the consequences of poor waveform sorting for correlation measures; here a supposedly isolated spike train is contaminated by some fraction of the activity of another train, a situation that unfortunately is all too common in experiments. All these distortions become far more serious in the more realistic situation of dynamic firing rates and correlations. This paper is intended as a cautionary note for those who want to draw inferences about neuronal organization and/or coding or representation by using cross-correlation analysis of unresolved recordings.},

To test this common assumption, we used a system identification approach to measure spatial frequency and orientation tuning in area V4 during two attentionally demanding visual search tasks, one that required fixation and one that allowed free viewing during search. We found that spatial attention modulates response baseline and gain but does not alter tuning, consistent with previous reports. In contrast, feature-based attention often shifts neuronal tuning. These tuning shifts are inconsistent with the labeled-line model and tend to enhance responses to stimulus features that distinguish the search target. Our data suggest that V4 neurons behave as matched filters that are dynamically tuned to optimize visual search.},

The techniques developed fall into the general category of multivariate time series analysis, and in particular we extensively use the multitaper framework of spectral analysis. We develop specific protocols for the analysis of fMRI, optical imaging, and MEG data, and illustrate the techniques by applications to real data sets generated by these imaging modalities. In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct stages: "noise" characterization and suppression, and "signal" characterization and visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is the utility of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving analysis windows to account for nonstationarity in the data. Of particular note are 1) the development of a decomposition technique (space-frequency singular value decomposition) that is shown to be a useful means of characterizing the image data, and 2) the development of an algorithm, based on multitaper methods, for the removal of approximately periodic physiological artifacts arising from cardiac and respiratory sources.},

abstract = {This investigation attempted to determine the mode of distribution

and synaptic targets of the cartwheel cell axon in the guinea pig

dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCoN). Antiserum against PEP-19, a putative

calcium-binding neuropeptide, was employed at the light and electron

microscopic levels. We show that in the hind-brain of the guinea

pig, cerebellar Purkinje cells and DCoN cartwheel cells are the most

densely immunoreactive neurons. The PEP-19 immunoreaction product

is localized to all neuronal compartments of these cells. Primary

targets of cartwheel cell axons are the DCoN pyramidal cells, the

large efferent neurons of layer 2. These neurons receive numerous

immunoreactive synaptic boutons on their cell bodies and apical and

basal dendritic arbors. A PEP-19-immunoreactive axonal plexus, largely

formed by cartwheel cell axons, highlights layer 3, co-extensively

with the basal arbors of pyramidal cells. This plexus is oriented

predominantly in the transstrial plane of the DCoN, in parallel with

the sheet-like basal dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons and with

the isofrequency bands of primary cochlear nerve fibers. PEP-19-positive

boutons contain pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and form symmetric

synaptic junctions, indicative of inhibitory innervation. In addition,

immunoreactive boutons, similar to those synapsing on pyramidal neurons,

were observed on the cell bodies and main dendritic trunks of cartwheel

neurons, indicating a system of recurrent collaterals. Furthermore,

a small number of PEP-19-positive axons of unknown origin reach the

caudal rim of the posteroventral cochlear nucleus. Within the territory

of distribution of the cartwheel cell axon are the dendrites of at

least two other types of DCoN neuron, the vertical cells of Lorente

de N� and the giant cells. These neurons may represent additional

targets of the cartwheel cell axon, but this remains to be ascertained

with specific methods. Our data demonstrate that the cartwheel neurons

modulate the activity of pyramidal neurons and, therefore, play a

key role in shaping the output of the DCoN superficial layers.},

abstract = {Book Description


The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods

for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an

a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for

model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the

analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention

on a priori science hypotheses and modeling. Kullback-Leibler Information

represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's

basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function

can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler

information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and

various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy

to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information

theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension

of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory,

and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class

of empirical problems. The book presents several new ways to incorporate

model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates

of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate

various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily

for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from

multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference

for professional analysts.

abstract = {The inferior temporal cortex (IT) of primates is thought to be the final visual area in the ventral stream of cortical areas responsible for object recognition. Consistent with this hypothesis, single IT neurons respond selectively to highly complex visual stimuli such as faces. However, a direct causal link between the activity of face-selective neurons and face perception has not been demonstrated. In the present study of macaque monkeys, we artificially activated small clusters of IT neurons by means of electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed a categorization task, judging whether noisy visual images belonged to 'face' or 'non-face' categories. Here we show that microstimulation of face-selective sites, but not other sites, strongly biased the monkeys' decisions towards the face category. The magnitude of the effect depended upon the degree of face selectivity of the stimulation site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face-selective neurons, and the exact timing of microstimulation. Our results establish a causal relationship between the activity of face-selective neurons and face perception.},

Localized analysis of the control and AD subjects only on the coordinates of the population template demonstrates shape changes in the subiculum and the CA1 subfield in AD (P < 0.05).

density images were obtained from 10 normal subjects, 3 patients

Sejnowski after prewhitening operations. The three independent components

T1 components representing myelin of white matter and lipids, (2)
relatively short T1 components representing gray matter and (3) long
T2 components representing free water. The involvement of gray or
white matter in brain tumor cases and the demyelination in the case
of multiple sclerosis were enhanced and visualized in independent
component images. ICA can potentially achieve separation of tissues
with different relaxation characteristics and generate new contrast
images of gray and white matter. With the proper choice of contrast
for the original images, ICA may be useful not only for extracting
subtle or hidden changes but also for preprocessing transformation
before clustering and segmenting the structure of the human brain.},

The model in this study consists of four neural populations. The pattern of convergence from one population to another and the strengths of those connections are the most important model parameters. Lumped parameter electrical circuit models represent individual cells. Interconnections are achieved by activating variable conductances in post-synaptic cells according to spike activity in pre-synaptic cells. Auditory nerve fibers are incorporated as a bank of logarithmically spaced gammatone filters that drive compartmental models of inner hair cell function. While it might be possible to configure the model without wideband inhibition to simulate type IV unit notch noise responses, the resulting parameters would likely be physiologically implausible. The model with wideband inhibition, however, shows the appropriate notch noise behavior. A wide variety of simulated rate versus cutoff-frequency plots are achieved varying three model parameters. The model was fit to physiological data by finding values of these three parameters that minimize the sum of squared errors. The results show that wideband inhibition can quantitatively account for the responses of type IV units to notch noise.},

Single-trial recordings of action potentials exhibited signal-to-noise ratios of approximately 5:1 and fractional fluorescence changes of up to approximately 10\%.

Here we demonstrate the measurement of a novel I-V curve measured while the neuron exhibits a fluctuating voltage and emits spikes. This dynamic I-V curve requires only a few tens of seconds of experimental time and so lends itself readily to the rapid classification of cell type, quantification of heterogeneities in cell populations, and generation of reduced analytical models. We apply this technique to layer-5 pyramidal cells and show that their dynamic I-V curve comprises linear and exponential components, providing experimental evidence for a recently proposed theoretical model. The approach also allows us to determine the change of neuronal response properties after a spike, millisecond by millisecond, so that postspike refractoriness of pyramidal cells can be quantified. Observations of I-V curves during and in absence of refractoriness are cast into a model that is used to predict both the subthreshold response and spiking activity of the neuron to novel stimuli. The predictions of the resulting model are in excellent agreement with experimental data and close to the intrinsic neuronal reproducibility to repeated stimuli.},

abstract = {Randomness is a fundamental feature of nature and a valuable resource for applications ranging from cryptography and gambling to numerical simulation of physical and biological systems. Random numbers, however, are difficult to characterize mathematically, and their generation must rely on an unpredictable physical process. Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes or failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control and detect. Here, inspired by earlier work on non-locality-based and device-independent quantum information processing, we show that the non-local correlations of entangled quantum particles can be used to certify the presence of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design a cryptographically secure random number generator that does not require any assumption about the internal working of the device. Such a strong form of randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems only if certified by a Bell inequality violation. We carry out a proof-of-concept demonstration of this proposal in a system of two entangled atoms separated by approximately one metre. The observed Bell inequality violation, featuring near perfect detection efficiency, guarantees that 42 new random numbers are generated with 99 per cent confidence. Our results lay the groundwork for future device-independent quantum information experiments and for addressing fundamental issues raised by the intrinsic randomness of quantum theory.},

abstract = {Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly before a postsynaptic neuron and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron's response variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron's output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an objective function that minimizes response variability and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena, including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic efficacy increases. We compare our account to other efforts to derive STDP from computational principles and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of unsupervised cortical adaptation.},

Structural plasticity in thalamocortical afferents was mostly due to elongation and retraction of branches (range, 1-150 microm over 4 days; approximately 5\% of total axonal length), while the majority of boutons persisted for up to 9 months (persistence over 1 month approximately 85\%). In contrast, L6 axon terminaux boutons were highly plastic (persistence over 1 month approximately 40 \%), and other intracortical axon boutons showed intermediate levels of plasticity. Retrospective electron microscopy revealed that new boutons make synapses. Our data suggest that structural plasticity of axonal branches and boutons contributes to the remodeling of specific functional circuits.},

explaining the detailed structure of galaxies. One of the major problems
is that galactic halos are too centrally concentrated. Dark matter
self-interactions have been proposed as a possible means of resolving
this inconsistency. Here, we investigate quantitatively the effect
of dark matter self interactions on formation of galactic halos.
Our numerical framework is extremely simple, while still keeping
the essential physics. We confirm that strongly self-interacting
dark matter leads to less centrally concentrated structures. Interestingly,
we find that for a range of different interaction strengths, the
dark matter halos are unstable to particle ejection on a timescale
comparable to the Hubble time.},

abstract = {Cartwheel cells are prominent interneurons in the dorsal cochlear
nucleus (DCN) that bear considerable homology to cerebellar Purkinje
cells. They contact other cartwheel cells as well as fusiform cells,
the principal cells of the DCN. In fusiform cells, the inhibition
from cartwheel cells interacts with excitation mediated by granule
cells and auditory nerve fibers, and shapes the output of the DCN
in its ascent to the inferior colliculi. With intracellular recordings
from anatomically identified cells in slices, synaptic inputs to
fusiform and cartwheel cells were analyzed pharmacologically. Shocks
to the auditory nerve and granule cell domains evoked glutamatergic,
glycinergic, and GABA(A)ergic postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in both
cartwheel and fusiform cells. The temporal patterns of spontaneous
and evoked glycinergic PSPs in fusiform and cartwheel cells were
similar and mirrored the pattern of firing of cartwheel cells, probably
reflecting the anatomical connections between these cell types and
supporting the conclusion that cartwheel cells are glycinergic. In
fusiform cells, glycinergic and GABA(A)ergic IPSPs evoked with shocks
reversed at -68 mV on average. In marked contrast, glycinergic and
GABA(A)ergic PSPs in cartwheel cells, as well as responses to exogenous
application of 50-100 mM glycine or 100 microns muscimol, were depolarizing.
Reversal potentials of PSPs and responses to glycine and muscimol
were similar and averaged -52 mV. Glycinergic and GABA(A)ergic PSPs
could elicit firing from cartwheel cells at their resting potentials,
but could also reduce rapid firing during strong depolarizations.
Thus, the action of glycinergic and GABA(A)ergic inputs on cartwheel
cells depends on the electrophysiological context in which they occur.},

A new method is introduced to find these patterns in raw multitrial data and is tested on surrogate data sets. Using it, multiple coexisting spike patterns were discovered in pyramidal cells recorded from rat prefrontal cortex in vitro, in data obtained in vivo from the middle temporal area of the monkey (Buracas et al., 1998) and from the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (Reinagel and Reid, 2002). The spike patterns lasted from a few tens of milliseconds in vitro to several seconds in vivo.

At individual sites, evoked activity to natural scenes was weakly correlated with the local image contrast structure falling within the cells' classical receptive field. However, a population code, derived from activity integrated across cortical sites having retinotopically overlapping receptive fields, correlated strongly with the local image contrast structure. Cell responses demonstrated high lifetime sparseness, population sparseness, and high dispersal values, implying efficient neural coding in terms of information processing. These results indicate that while cells at an individual cortical site do not provide a reliable estimate of the local contrast structure in natural scenes, cell activity integrated across distributed cortical sites is closely related to this structure in the form of a sparse and dispersed code.},

anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when
the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests
that attention has coopted the circuits that mediate contrast gain
control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast
of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation
of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the
allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases
in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and amont neurons in
area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast
sensitivity. Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory

We report that independent inputs cannot account for this high variability, but this variability can be explained by a simple alternative model of the synaptic drive in which inputs arrive synchronously. Our results suggest that synchrony may be important in the neural code by providing a means for encoding signals with high temporal fidelity over a population of neurons.},

abstract = {The analysis of extra-cellular neural recordings typically begins with careful spike sorting and all analysis of the data then rests on the correctness of the resulting spike trains. In many situations this is unproblematic as experimental and spike sorting procedures often focus on well isolated units. There is evidence in the literature, however, that errors in spike sorting can occur even with carefully collected and selected data. Additionally, chronically implanted electrodes and arrays with fixed electrodes cannot be easily adjusted to provide well isolated units. In these situations, multiple units may be recorded and the assignment of waveforms to units may be ambiguous. At the same time, analysis of such data may be both scientifically important and clinically relevant. In this paper we address this issue using a novel probabilistic model that accounts for several important sources of uncertainty and error in spike sorting. In lieu of sorting neural data to produce a single best spike train, we estimate a probabilistic model of spike trains given the observed data. We show how such a distribution over spike sortings can support standard neuroscientific questions while providing a representation of uncertainty in the analysis. As a representative illustration of the approach, we analyzed primary motor cortical tuning with respect to hand movement in data recorded with a chronic multi-electrode array in non-human primates. We found that the probabilistic analysis generally agrees with human sorters but suggests the presence of tuned units not detected by humans.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic
and should be handled with care. It can be inhaled and absorbed through
the skin and mucous membranes. The most toxic forms of mercury are
its organic compounds such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury.
Fish have a natural tendency to accumulate mercury. Methylmercury
is produced by microbial methylation of inorganic mercury in water
sediment then it infiltrates the food chain and it consequently accumulates
in fish. Fish are the main source of methylmercury in human food.
Mercury is transferred into a hair; and this can be than used to
monitor the long-term exposure to mercury. The content of mercury
in hair depends on the frequency of fish consumption. The aim of
our study was to compare mercury content in the hair of children
that had various amounts of fish consumption (increased or reduced).
DESIGN: Total mercury content in hair was determined by direct method
of cold vapors using an AMA 245 analyzer. A total of 174 hair samples
from the children (9-17 years old) were analyzed. In this study,
the following localities were compared: Neratovice (n=42), Jesen\'{\i}ky
(n=44), Prague (n=59) in Czech Republic and Olsztyn in Poland (n=29).
Every sample was accompanied with questionnaire about age, gender,
regions, amalgam fillings and fish consumption. RESULTS: We did not
find a correlation between the content of mercury in hair with age,
gender or amalgam fillings. We did find a correlation between fish
consumption and the amount of mercury found in the hair samples.
CONCLUSION: The amount of mercury in hair increases with more frequent
consumption of freshwater and marine fish.},

memory for events occurring before his severe traumatic brain injury,
yet his anterograde (post-injury) learning and memory appeared intact,
a syndrome known as isolated or focal retrograde amnesia. Studies
with M.L. demonstrated a dissociation between episodic and semantic
memory. His retrograde amnesia was specific to episodic autobiographical
memory. Convergent behavioral and functional imaging data suggested
that his anterograde memory, while appearing normal, was accomplished
with reduced autonoetic awareness (awareness of the self as a continuous
entity across time that is a crucial element of episodic memory).
While previous research on M.L. focused on anterograde memory of
laboratory stimuli, in this study, M.L.'s autobiographical memory
for post-injury events or anterograde autobiographical memory was
examined using prospective collection of autobiographical events
via audio diary with detailed behavioral and functional neuroanatomical
analysis. Consistent with his reports of subjective disconnection
from post-injury autobiographical events, M.L. assigned fewer "remember"
ratings to his autobiographical events than comparison subjects.
His generation of event-specific details using the Autobiographical

but not significantly so, suggesting that it is possible to generate
episodic-like details even when re-experiencing of those details
is compromised. While listening to the autobiographical audio diary
segments, M.L. showed reduced activation relative to comparison subjects
in midline frontal and posterior nodes previously identified as part
of the autobiographical memory network. Reductions were also evident
in M.L. in association with personal semantic stimuli (e.g., recordings
describing personal habits and routines). These data suggest an association
between M.L.'s impoverished recollection of autobiographical material
and reduced activation in midline sectors of the autobiographical
memory network that support the autonoetic, first-person element
of episodic memory.},

unraveled important calcium-dependent mechanisms underlying neuronal

function and development. However, difficulties associated with the

loading of calcium indicators have limited their widespread use,

particularly for the study of neuronal processing in the adult nervous

system. Here, we show that in the central and peripheral nervous

systems, populations of neurons and their processes, including dendritic

spines and filopodia, can be labeled rapidly and efficiently by delivering

calcium indicator-coated particles using a 'gene gun'. Importantly,

neuronal labeling occurred both in vitro and in vivo, and across

a wide range of ages and preparations. The labeled cells demonstrate

spontaneous and evoked calcium transients, indicating that particle-mediated

delivery is not deleterious to neuronal function. Furthermore, unlike

loading with patch pipettes, cytoplasmic content is preserved following

ballistic loading. This enables the study of calcium-dependent second

messenger pathways without loss of signaling components. The ballistic

delivery of calcium indicators thus opens up many new avenues for

further exploration of the structure and function of the nervous

system from single spines to neuronal networks.},

In biology the most severe aberration is introduced when an oil-immersion objective lens is used to study thick specimens, such as living cells and tissues, whose refractive indices are significantly different from that of the immersion oil. We present a model of the three-dimensional imaging properties of a fluorescence light microscope subject to such aberration and compare the imaging properties predicted by the model with those measured experimentally. The model can be used to understand and compensate for aberration introduced to a microscope system under nondesign optical conditions so that both confocal laser scanning microscopy and optical serial sectioning microscopy can be optimized.},

Current studies of interneuron development and function benefit from the use of knock-out and transgenic mice, whereas none take advantage of the versatility of in utero electroporation. Here, we show how in utero electroporation can be directed to the ganglionic eminences to specifically target gene expression to interneurons. Electroporation of GFP-encoding plasmids into the ganglionic eminences results in selective labeling of migrating interneurons during development. In the adult brain of electroporated animals, a wide variety of cortical, hippocampal and olfactory bulb interneurons are labeled. We also show that GFP-expressing interneurons can be visualized in living slices of adult cerebral cortex, where they display normal electrophysiological properties. Photostimulation studies using acute slices show that cortical GFP+ interneurons receive normal, layer-specific synaptic input, indicating that these neurons integrate within the local cortical circuitry. Ganglionic eminence-directed in utero electroporation is therefore an effective, rapid, and versatile method of selectively transfecting telencephalic interneurons, optimal for both developmental studies and adult functional studies.},

cells in the rat hippocampus was investigated using intracellular
injection of horseradish peroxidase in the in vitro hippocampal slice
preparation and computer-aided reconstruction. The total dendritic
length, dendritic length in each of the hippocampal laminae, and
the number of dendritic branches were measured in 20 CA1 pyramidal
cells, 7 neurons in CA2 and 20 CA3 pyramidal cells. The total dendritic
length of CA3 pyramidal cells varied in a consistent fashion depending
on their position within the field. Cells located close to the dentate
gyrus had the smallest dendritic trees which averaged 9,300 microns
in total length. Cells in the distal part of CA3 (near CA2) had the
largest dendritic trees, averaging 15,800 microns. The CA2 field
contained cells which resembled CA3 pyramidal cells in most respects
except for the absence of thorny excrescences on their proximal dendrites.
There were also smaller pyramidal cells that resembled CA1 neurons.
CA1 pyramidal cells tended to be more homogeneous. Pyramidal neurons
throughout the transverse extent of CA1 had a total dendritic length
on the order of 13,500 microns. The quantitative analysis of the
laminar distribution of dendrites demonstrated that the stratum oriens
and stratum radiatum contained significant portions of the pyramidal
cell dendritic trees. In Ca3, for example, 42-51\% of the total dendritic
length was located in stratum oriens; about 34\% of the dendritic
tree was located in stratum radiatium. The amount of dendritic length
in stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA3 varied depending on the location
of the cell. Many CA3 cells located within the limbs of the dentate
gyrus, for example, had no dendrites extending into stratum lacunosum-moleculare
whereas those located distally in CA3 had about the same percentage
of their dendritic tree in stratum lacunosum-moleculare as in stratum
radiatum. In CA1, nearly half of the dendritic length was located
in stratum radiatum, 34\% was in stratum oriens and 18\% was in stratum
lacunosum-moleculare. These studies identified distinctive dendritic
branching patterns, in the stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare,
which clearly distinguished CA3 from CA1 neurons.},

The method takes advantage of the fact that physiological changes in dark-adapted retinas caused by light stimulation can result in local variation of the tissue reflectivity. fUHROCT scans were acquired from isolated retinas synchronously with electrical recordings before, during, and after light stimulation. Pronounced stimulus-related changes in the retinal reflectivity profile were observed in the inner/outer segments of the photoreceptor layer and the plexiform layers. Control experiments (e.g., dark adaptation vs. light stimulation), pharmacological inhibition of photoreceptor function, and synaptic transmission to the inner retina confirmed that the origin of the observed optical changes is the altered physiological state of the retina evoked by the light stimulus. We have demonstrated that fUHROCT allows for simultaneous, noninvasive probing of both retinal morphology and function, which could significantly improve the early diagnosis of various ophthalmic pathologies and could lead to better understanding of pathogenesis.},

We present a Bayesian neural spike train decoding algorithm based on a point process model of individual neurons, a linear stochastic state-space model of the biological signal, and a temporal latency parameter. The latency parameter represents the temporal lead or lag between the biological signal and the ensemble spiking activity. We use the algorithm to study whether the representation of position by the ensemble spiking activity of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus is more consistent with prospective coding, i.e., future position, or retrospective coding, past position. Using 44 simultaneously recorded neurons and an ensemble delay latency of 400 ms, the median decoding error was 5.1 cm during 10 min of foraging in an open circular environment. The true coverage probability for the algorithm's 0.95 confidence regions was 0.71. These results illustrate how the Bayesian neural spike train decoding paradigm may be used to investigate spatio-temporal representations of position by an ensemble of hippocampal neurons.},

abstract = {Hearing loss due to peripheral damage is associated with cochlear hair cell damage or loss and some retrograde degeneration of auditory nerve fibers. Surviving auditory nerve fibers in the impaired region exhibit elevated and broadened frequency tuning, and the cochleotopic representation of broadband stimuli such as speech is distorted. In impaired cortical regions, increased tuning to frequencies near the edge of the hearing loss coupled with increased spontaneous and synchronous firing is observed. Tinnitus, an auditory percept in the absence of sensory input, may arise under these circumstances as a result of plastic reorganization in the auditory cortex. We present a spiking neuron model of auditory cortex that captures several key features of cortical organization. A key assumption in the model is that in response to reduced afferent excitatory input in the damaged region, a compensatory change in the connection strengths of lateral excitatory and inhibitory connections occurs. These changes allow the model to capture some of the cortical correlates of sensorineural hearing loss, including changes in spontaneous firing and synchrony; these phenomena may explain central tinnitus. This model may also be useful for evaluating procedures designed to segregate synchronous activity underlying tinnitus and for evaluating adaptive hearing devices that compensate for selective hearing loss.},

abstract = {Higher cortical functions (perception, cognition, learning and memory)
are in large part based on the integration of electrical and calcium
signals that takes place in thin dendritic branches of neocortical
pyramidal cells (synaptic integration). The mechanisms underlying
the synaptic integration in thin basal dendrites are largely unexplored.
We use a recently developed technique, multisite voltage-calcium
imaging, to compare voltage and calcium transients from multiple
locations along individual dendritic branches. Our results reveal
characteristic electrical transients (plateau potentials) that trigger
and shape dendritic calcium dynamics and calcium distribution during
suprathreshold glutamatergic synaptic input. We regularly observed
three classes of voltage-calcium interactions occurring simultaneously
in three different zones of the same dendritic branch: (1) proximal
to the input site, (2) at the input site, and (3) distal to the input
site. One hundred micrometers away from the synaptic input site,
both proximally and distally, dendritic calcium transients are in
tight temporal correlation with the dendritic plateau potential.
However, on the same dendrite, at the location of excitatory input,
calcium transients outlast local dendritic plateau potentials by
severalfold. These Ca2+ plateaus (duration 0.5-2 s) are spatially
restricted to the synaptic input site, where they cause a brief down-regulation
of dendritic excitability. Ca2+ plateaus are not mediated by Ca2+
release from intracellular stores, but rather by an NMDA-dependent
small-amplitude depolarization, which persists after the collapse
of the dendritic plateau potential. These unique features of dendritic
voltage and calcium distributions may provide distinct zones for
simultaneous long-term (bidirectional) modulation of synaptic contacts
along the same basal branch. },

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the features of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)
used by North American homeless outreach organizations. METHODS:
Twenty-eight homeless outreach agencies throughout North America
were contacted. Nine used EMRs for homeless outreach. Service providers
from these nine agencies were interviewed to learn more about their
EMRs. RESULTS: While all of the agencies we interviewed were using
different EMR systems, the important features of these EMRs were
quite similar. Two of the most frequently cited essential features
were: 1) the ability of different sites and providers to access medical
information; and 2) the capacity to collect aggregated client data
(such as numbers of clients served, services provided, and outcomes)
for planning, evaluation, and advocacy purposes. CONCLUSION: An electronic
medical record (EMR) available at multiple locations to multiple
providers is a powerful tool with the potential to improve the coordination,
safety, efficiency, and quality of care to people who are homeless.},

abstract = {It is well known that the density of neurons varies within the adult brain. In neocortex, this includes variations in neuronal density between different lamina as well as between different regions. Yet the concomitant variation of the microvessels is largely uncharted. Here, we present automated histological, imaging, and analysis tools to simultaneously map the locations of all neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei and the centerlines and diameters of all blood vessels within thick slabs of neocortex from mice. Based on total inventory measurements of different cortical regions ( approximately 10(7) cells vectorized across brains), these methods revealed: (1) In three dimensions, the mean distance of the center of neuronal somata to the closest microvessel was 15 mum. (2) Volume samples within lamina of a given region show that the density of microvessels does not match the strong laminar variation in neuronal density. This holds for both agranular and granular cortex. (3) Volume samples in successive radii from the midline to the ventral-lateral edge, where each volume summed the number of cells and microvessels from the pia to the white matter, show a significant correlation between neuronal and microvessel densities. These data show that while neuronal and vascular densities do not track each other on the 100 mum scale of cortical lamina, they do track each other on the 1-10 mm scale of the cortical mantle. The absence of a disproportionate density of blood vessels in granular lamina is argued to be consistent with the initial locus of functional brain imaging signals.},

We present a machine learning approach to computing an affinity graph using a convolutional network (CN) trained using ground truth provided by human experts. The CN affinity graph can be paired with any standard partitioning algorithm and improves segmentation accuracy significantly compared to standard hand-designed affinity functions. We apply our algorithm to the challenging 3D segmentation problem of reconstructing neuronal processes from volumetric electron microscopy (EM) and show that we are able to learn a good affinity graph directly from the raw EM images. Further, we show that our affinity graph improves the segmentation accuracy of both simple and sophisticated graph partitioning algorithms. In contrast to previous work, we do not rely on prior knowledge in the form of hand-designed image features or image preprocessing. Thus, we expect our algorithm to generalize effectively to arbitrary image types.},

abstract = {The nervous system often combines visual and haptic information about object properties such that the combined estimate is more precise than with vision or haptics alone. We examined how the system determines when to combine the signals. Presumably, signals should not be combined when they come from different objects. The likelihood that signals come from different objects is highly correlated with the spatial separation between the signals, so we asked how the spatial separation between visual and haptic signals affects their combination. To do this, we first created conditions for each observer in which the effect of combination--the increase in discrimination precision with two modalities relative to performance with one modality--should be maximal. Then under these conditions, we presented visual and haptic stimuli separated by different spatial distances and compared human performance with predictions of a model that combined signals optimally. We found that discrimination precision was essentially optimal when the signals came from the same location, and that discrimination precision was poorer when the signals came from different locations. Thus, the mechanism of visual-haptic combination is specialized for signals that coincide in space.},

abstract = {Neuronal response properties are typically probed by intracellular measurements of current-voltage (I-V) relationships during application of current or voltage steps. Here we demonstrate the measurement of a novel I-V curve measured while the neuron exhibits a fluctuating voltage and emits spikes. This dynamic I-V curve requires only a few tens of seconds of experimental time and so lends itself readily to the rapid classification of cell type, quantification of heterogeneities in cell populations, and generation of reduced analytical models. We apply this technique to layer-5 pyramidal cells and show that their dynamic I-V curve comprises linear and exponential components, providing experimental evidence for a recently proposed theoretical model. The approach also allows us to determine the change of neuronal response properties after a spike, millisecond by millisecond, so that postspike refractoriness of pyramidal cells can be quantified. Observations of I-V curves during and in absence of refractoriness are cast into a model that is used to predict both the subthreshold response and spiking activity of the neuron to novel stimuli. The predictions of the resulting model are in excellent agreement with experimental data and close to the intrinsic neuronal reproducibility to repeated stimuli.},

abstract = {Ocular following (OFR) is a short-latency visual stabilization response to the optic flow experienced during self-motion. It has been proposed that it represents the early component of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) and that it is functionally linked to the vestibularly driven stabilization reflex during translation (translational vestibuloocular reflex, TVOR). Because no single eye movement can eliminate slip from the whole retina during translation, the OFR and the TVOR appear to be functionally related to maintaining visual acuity on the fovea. Other foveal-specific eye movements, like smooth pursuit and saccades, exhibit an eye-position-dependent torsional component, as dictated by what is known as the "half-angle rule" of Listing's law. In contrast, eye movements that stabilize images on the whole retina, such as the rotational vestibuloocular reflex (RVOR) and steady-state OKN do not. Consistent with the foveal stabilization hypothesis, it was recently shown that the TVOR is indeed characterized by an eye-position-dependent torsion, similar to pursuit eye movements. Here we have investigated whether the OFR exhibits three-dimensional kinematic properties consistent with a foveal response (i.e., similar to the TVOR and smooth pursuit eye movements) or with a whole-field stabilization function (similar to steady-state OKN). The OFR was elicited using 100-ms ramp motion of a full-field random dot pattern that moved horizontally at 20, 62, or 83 degrees/s. To study if an eye-position-dependent torsion is generated during the OFR, we varied the initial fixation position vertically within a range of +/-20 degrees . As a control, horizontal smooth pursuit eye movements were also elicited using step-ramp target motion (10, 20, or 30 degrees/s) at similar eccentric positions. We found that the OFR followed kinematic properties similar to those seen in pursuit and the TVOR with the eye-position-dependent torsional tilt of eye velocity having slopes that averaged 0.73 +/- 0.16 for OFR and 0.57 +/- 0.12 (means +/- SD) for pursuit. These findings support the notion that the OFR, like the TVOR and pursuit, are foveal image stabilization systems.},

@article{Lima2009,
abstract = {Neural circuits are exquisitely organized, consisting of many different neuronal subpopulations. However, it is difficult to assess the functional roles of these subpopulations using conventional extracellular recording techniques because these techniques do not easily distinguish spikes from different neuronal populations. To overcome this limitation, we have developed PINP (Photostimulation-assisted Identification of Neuronal Populations), a method of tagging neuronal populations for identification during in vivo electrophysiological recording. The method is based on expressing the light-activated channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to restricted neuronal subpopulations. ChR2-tagged neurons can be detected electrophysiologically in vivo since illumination of these neurons with a brief flash of blue light triggers a short latency reliable action potential. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique by expressing ChR2 in distinct populations of cortical neurons using two different strategies. First, we labeled a subpopulation of cortical neurons-mainly fast-spiking interneurons-by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver ChR2 in a transgenic mouse line in which the expression of Cre recombinase was driven by the parvalbumin promoter. Second, we labeled subpopulations of excitatory neurons in the rat auditory cortex with ChR2 based on projection target by using herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), which is efficiently taken up by axons and transported retrogradely; we find that this latter population responds to acoustic stimulation differently from unlabeled neurons. Tagging neurons is a novel application of ChR2, used in this case to monitor activity instead of manipulating it. PINP can be readily extended to other populations of genetically identifiable neurons, and will provide a useful method for probing the functional role of different neuronal populations in vivo.},

abstract = {Despite growing interest in applying machine learning to neuroimaging analyses, few studies have gone beyond classifying sensory input to directly predicting behavioral output. With spatial resolution on the order of millimeters and temporal resolution on the order of seconds, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising technology for such applications. However, fMRI data's low signal-to-noise ratio, high dimensionality, and extensive spatiotemporal correlations present formidable analytic challenges. Here, we apply different machine-learning algorithms to previously acquired data to examine the ability of fMRI activation in three regions-the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and insula-to predict purchasing. Our goal was to improve spatiotemporal interpretability as well as classification accuracy. To this end, sparse penalized discriminant analysis (SPDA) enabled automatic selection of correlated variables, yielding interpretable models that generalized well to new data. Relative to logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and linear support vector machines, SPDA not only increased interpretability but also improved classification accuracy. SPDA promises to allow more precise inferences about when specific brain regions contribute to purchasing decisions. More broadly, this approach provides a general framework for using neuroimaging data to build interpretable models, including those that predict choice.},

We describe a very simple "organism" that performs this task, exemplified here by recognition of spoken monosyllables. The network's computation can be understood through the application of simple but generally unexploited principles describing neural activity. The organism is a network of very simple neurons and synapses; the experiments are simulations. The network's recognition capabilities are robust to variations across speakers, simple masking noises, and large variations in system parameters. The network principles underlying recognition of short temporal sequences are applied here to speech, but similar ideas can be applied to aspects of vision, touch, and olfaction. In this article, we describe only properties of the system that could be measured if it were a real biological organism. We delay publication of the principles behind the network's operation as an intellectual challenge: the essential principles of operation can be deduced based on the experimental results presented here alone.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been stated that rates of homicide due to mental disorder are constant over time. AIMS: To examine whether there were changes in the rates of homicide due to mental disorder over time, and whether changes in these rates were associated with changes in the rates of other homicides in England and Wales. METHOD: Examination of four sets of official homicide statistics from England and Wales from 1946 to 2004. RESULTS: The rate of total homicide and the rate of homicide due to mental disorder rose steadily until the mid-1970s. From then there was a reversal in the rate of homicides attributed to mental disorder, which declined to historically low levels, while other homicides continued to rise. CONCLUSIONS: The reasons for the rise and fall in homicides attributed to mental disorder are not clear. The earlier increase in such homicides may have been due to the same sociological factors that caused the increase in other homicides over that time. The subsequent decline may have been due to improvements in psychiatric treatments and service organisation. Another possibility is that there has been an informal change to the legal tests for the finding of homicide due to mental disorder.},

abstract = {Upon irradiation, flavin oxidises 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol to the corresponding
aldehyde using aerial O(2) as the terminal oxidant. We have observed
that this reaction is significantly accelerated by the presence of
thiourea. A series of thiourea-functionalised flavins has been prepared
from flavin isothiocyanates and their photocatalytic efficiencies
have been monitored by NMR. The alcohol photooxidation proceeds rapidly
and cleanly with high turnover numbers of up to 580, exceeding previously
reported performances. A likely mechanistic rationale for the more
than 30-fold acceleration of the photo-redox reaction by thiourea
has been derived from spectroscopic, electrochemical, and kinetic
studies. Thus, thiourea acts as an electron-transfer mediator for
the initial photooxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol by the excited
flavins. This mechanism has similarities to electron-relay mechanisms
in flavoenzymes, for which cysteine sulfenic acid intermediates are
proposed. The observation that thiourea mediates flavin photo-redox
processes is valuable for the design of more sophisticated photocatalysts
based on Nature's best redox chromophore.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There
is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations
in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition
rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains
or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate
an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to
learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast
to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector
quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations.
Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other
methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints
lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive,
not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization
is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge
by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never
negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

abstract = {In the machine learning field, the performance of a classifier is usually measured in terms of prediction error. In most real-world problems, the error cannot be exactly calculated and it must be estimated. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate estimator of the error. This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the kappa-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (kappa-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the kappa-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of kappa. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training sets coming from assorted probability distributions. We conclude by including some practical recommendation on the use of kappa-fold cross validation.},

@article{OlivaSwann00,
abstract = {The chief inhibitory neurons of the mammalian brain, GABAergic neurons,
are comprised of a myriad of diverse neuronal subtypes. To facilitate
the study of these neurons, transgenic mice were generated that express
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in subpopulations of GABAergic
neurons. In one of the resulting transgenic lines, called GIN (GFP-expressing
Inhibitory Neurons), EGFP was found to be expressed in a subpopulation
of somatostatin-containing GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus
and neocortex. In both live and fixed brain preparations from these
mice, detailed microanatomical features of EGFP-expressing interneurons
were readily observed. In stratum oriens of the hippocampus, EGFP-expressing
interneurons were comprised almost exclusively of oriens/alveus interneurons
with lacunosum-moleculare axon arborization (O-LM cells). In the
neocortex, the somata of EGFP-expressing interneurons were largely
restricted to layers II-IV and upper layer V. In hippocampal area
CA1, two previously uncharacterized subtypes of interneurons were
identified using the GIN mice: stratum pyramidale interneurons with
lacunosum-moleculare axon arborization (P-LM cells) and stratum radiatum
interneurons with lacunosum-moleculare axon arborization (R-LM cells).
These newly identified interneuronal subtypes appeared to be closely
related to O-LM cell, as they selectively innervate stratum lacunosum-moleculare.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that these cells were
fast-spiking and showed virtually no spike frequency accommodation.
The microanatomical features of these cells suggest that they function
primarily as "input-biasing" neurons, in that synaptic volleys in
stratum radiatum would lead to their activation, which in turn would
result in selective suppression of excitatory input from the entorhinal
cortex onto CA1 pyramidal cells.},

abstract = {Multi-photon microscopy (MPM) is a powerful tool for biomedical imaging, enabling molecular contrast and integrated structural and functional imaging on the cellular and subcellular level. However, the cost and complexity of femtosecond laser sources that are required in MPM are significant hurdles to widespread adoption of this important imaging modality. In this work, we describe femtosecond diode pumped Cr:LiCAF laser technology as a low cost alternative to femtosecond Ti:Sapphire lasers for MPM. Using single mode pump diodes which cost only \$150 each, a diode pumped Cr:LiCAF laser generates approximately 70-fs duration, 1.8-nJ pulses at approximately 800 nm wavelengths, with a repetition rate of 100 MHz and average output power of 180 mW. Representative examples of MPM imaging in neuroscience, immunology, endocrinology and cancer research using Cr:LiCAF laser technology are presented. These studies demonstrate the potential of this laser source for use in a broad range of MPM applications.},

constituents of genetically encoded indicators of signal transduction

Q69M confers a much lower pK(a) (5.7) than for previous YFPs, indifference

to chloride, twice the photostability of previous YFPs, and much

better expression at 37 degrees C and in organelles. The halide resistance

is explained by a 2.2-A x-ray crystal structure of Citrine, showing

that the methionine side chain fills what was once a large halide-binding

cavity adjacent to the chromophore. Insertion of calmodulin within

Citrine or fusion of cyan fluorescent protein, calmodulin, a calmodulin-binding

peptide and Citrine has generated improved calcium indicators. These

chimeras can be targeted to multiple cellular locations and have

abstract = {This paper describes a framework for learning probabilistic models
of objects and scenes and for exploiting these models for tracking
complex, deformable, or articulated objects in image sequences. We
focus on the probabilistic tracking of people and learn models of
how they appear and move in images. In particular, we learn the likelihood
of observing various spatial and temporal filter responses corresponding
to edges, ridges, and motion differences given a model of the person.
Similarly, we learn probability distributions over filter responses
for general scenes that define a likelihood of observing the filter
responses for arbitrary backgrounds. We then derive a probabilistic
model for tracking that exploits the ratio between the likelihood
that image pixels corresponding to the foreground (person) were generated
by an actual person or by some unknown background. The paper extends
previous work on learning image statistics and combines it with Bayesian
tracking using particle filtering. By combining multiple image cues,
and by using learned likelihood models, we demonstrate improved robustness
and accuracy when tracking complex objects such as people in monocular
image sequences with cluttered scenes and a moving camera.},

The functional cell assembly hypothesis first described by Hebb (The Organization of Behavior; a Neuropsychological Theory. New York: Wiley; 1949) aimed to provide a mechanistic explanation of how groups of neurons, acting together, form a percept. The vast number of neurons potentially involved make testing this hypothesis exceedingly difficult as neither the number nor locations of assembly members are known. Although increasing the number of neurons from which simultaneous recordings are made is of benefit, providing evidence for or against a hypothesis like Hebb's requires more than this.

protein is a highly variable region that is both functionally and

mutual information, a measure of covariation, to quantify dependence
between mutations in the loop. Certain pairs of sites, including
non-contiguous sites along the sequence, do not have independent
mutations but display considerable, statistically significant, covarying
mutations as measured by mutual information. For the pairs of sites
with the highest mutual information, specific amino acids were identified
that were highly predictive of amino acids in the linked site. The
observed interdependence between variable sites may have implications
for structural or functional relationships; separate experimental
evidence indicates functional linkage between some of the pairs of
sites with high mutual information. Further specific mutational studies
of the V3 loop's role in determining viral phenotype are suggested
by our analyses. Also, the implications of our results may be important
to consider for V3 peptide vaccine design. The methods used here

@article{Raphan2010a,
abstract = {Selection of an optimal estimator typically relies on either supervised training samples (pairs of measurements and their associated true values) or a prior probability model for the true values. Here, we consider the problem of obtaining a least squares estimator given a measurement process with known statistics (i.e., a likelihood function) and a set of unsupervised measurements, each arising from a corresponding true value drawn randomly from an unknown distribution. We develop a general expression for a nonparametric empirical Bayes least squares (NEBLS) estimator, which expresses the optimal least squares estimator in terms of the measurement density, with no explicit reference to the unknown (prior) density. We study the conditions under which such estimators exist and derive specific forms for a variety of different measurement processes. We further show that each of these NEBLS estimators may be used to express the mean squared estimation error as an expectation over the measurement density alone, thus generalizing Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which provides such an expression for the additive gaussian noise case. This error expression may then be optimized over noisy measurement samples, in the absence of supervised training data, yielding a generalized SURE-optimized parametric least squares (SURE2PLS) estimator. In the special case of a linear parameterization (i.e., a sum of nonlinear kernel functions), the objective function is quadratic, and we derive an incremental form for learning this estimator from data. We also show that combining the NEBLS form with its corresponding generalized SURE expression produces a generalization of the score-matching procedure for parametric density estimation. Finally, we have implemented several examples of such estimators, and we show that their performance is comparable to their optimal Bayesian or supervised regression counterparts for moderate to large amounts of data.},

abstract = {Synchronized firing among neurons has been proposed to constitute an elementary aspect of the neural code in sensory and motor systems. However, it remains unclear how synchronized firing affects the large-scale patterns of activity and redundancy of visual signals in a complete population of neurons. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of retinal ganglion cells in primate retina, and examined synchronized firing in completely sampled populations of approximately 50-100 ON-parasol cells, which form a major projection to the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Synchronized firing in pairs of cells was a subset of a much larger pattern of activity that exhibited local, isotropic spatial properties. However, a simple model based solely on interactions between adjacent cells reproduced 99\% of the spatial structure and scale of synchronized firing. No more than 20\% of the variability in firing of an individual cell was predictable from the activity of its neighbors. These results held both for spontaneous firing and in the presence of independent visual modulation of the firing of each cell. In sum, large-scale synchronized firing in the entire population of ON-parasol cells appears to reflect simple neighbor interactions, rather than a unique visual signal or a highly redundant coding scheme.},

abstract = {High quality 3D visualization of anatomic structures is necessary for many applications. The anatomic structures first need to be segmented. A variety of segmentation algorithms have been developed for this purpose. For confocal microscopy images, the noise introduced during the specimen preparation process, such as the procedure of penetration or staining, may cause images to be of low contrast in some regions. This property will make segmentation difficult. Also, the segmented structures may have rugged surfaces in 3D visualization. In this paper, we present a hybrid method that is suitable for segmentation of confocal microscopy images. A rough segmentation result is obtained from the atlas-based segmentation via affine registration. The boundaries of the segmentation result are close to the object boundaries, and are regarded as the initial contours of the active contour models. After convergence of the snake algorithm, the resulting contours in regions of low contrast are locally refined by parametric bicubic surfaces to alleviate the problem of incorrect convergence. The proposed method increases the accuracy of the snake algorithm because of better initial contours. Besides, it can provide smoother segmented results in 3D visualization.},

abstract = {Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly before a postsynaptic neuron and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron's response variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron's output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an objective function that minimizes response variability and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena, including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic efficacy increases. We compare our account to other efforts to derive STDP from computational principles and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of unsupervised cortical adaptation.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used to characterize tissue
micro-architecture and brain connectivity. Yet, DTI suffers serious
limitations in regions of crossing fibers because traditional tensor
techniques cannot represent multiple, independent intra-voxel orientations.
Compressed sensing has been proposed to resolve crossing fibers using
a tensor mixture model (e.g., Crossing Fiber Angular Resolution of
Intra-voxel structure, CFARI). Although similar in spirit to deconvolution
approaches, CFARI uses sparsity to stabilize estimation with limited
data rather than spatial consistency or limited model order. Here,
we extend the CFARI approach to resolve crossing fibers through a
strictly positive, parsimonious mixture model. Together with an optimized
preconditioned conjugate gradient solver, estimation error and computational
burden are greatly reduced over the initial presentation. Reliable
estimates of intra-voxel orientations are demonstrated in simulation
and in vivo using data representative of typical, low b-value (30
directions, 700 s/mm(2)) clinical DTI protocols. These sequences
are achievable in 5 minutes at 3 T, and the whole brain CFARI analysis
is tractable for routine analysis. With these improvements, CFARI
provides a robust framework for identifying intra-voxel structure
with traditional DTI and shows great promise in helping to resolve
the crossing fiber problem in current clinical imaging studies.},

This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the kappa-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (kappa-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the kappa-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of kappa. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training sets coming from assorted probability distributions. We conclude by including some practical recommendation on the use of kappa-fold cross validation.},

abstract = {The zebrafish larva is a powerful model for the analysis of behaviour and the underlying neuronal network activity during early stages of development. Here we employ a new approach of "in vivo" Ca(2+) imaging in this preparation. We demonstrate that bolus injection of membrane-permeable Ca(2+) indicator dyes into the spinal cord of zebrafish larvae results in rapid staining of essentially the entire spinal cord. Using two-photon imaging, we could monitor Ca(2+) signals simultaneously from a large population of spinal neurons with single-cell resolution. To test the method, Ca(2+) transients were produced by iontophoretic application of glutamate and, as observed for the first time in a living preparation, of GABA or glycine. Glycine-evoked Ca(2+) transients were blocked by the application of strychnine. Sensory stimuli that trigger escape reflexes in mobile zebrafish evoked Ca(2+) transients in distinct neurons of the spinal network. Moreover, long-term recordings revealed spontaneous Ca(2+) transients in individual spinal neurons. Frequently, this activity occurred synchronously among many neurons in the network. In conclusion, the new approach permits a reliable analysis with single-cell resolution of the functional organisation of developing neuronal networks.},

abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that task performance can rapidly and adaptively reshape cortical receptive field properties in accord with specific task demands and salient sensory cues. We recorded neuronal responses in the primary auditory cortex of behaving ferrets that were trained to detect a target tone of any frequency. Cortical plasticity was quantified by measuring focal changes in each cell's spectrotemporal response field (STRF) in a series of passive and active behavioral conditions. STRF measurements were made simultaneously with task performance, providing multiple snapshots of the dynamic STRF during ongoing behavior. Attending to a specific target frequency during the detection task consistently induced localized facilitative changes in STRF shape, which were swift in onset. Such modulatory changes may enhance overall cortical responsiveness to the target tone and increase the likelihood of 'capturing' the attended target during the detection task. Some receptive field changes persisted for hours after the task was over and hence may contribute to long-term sensory memory.},

abstract = {During the past few decades, optical methods for imaging activity in networks composed of thousands of neurons have been developed. These techniques rely mainly on organic-chemistry-based dyes as indicators of Ca(2+) and membrane potential. However, recently a new generation of probes, genetically encoded fluorescent protein sensors, has emerged for use by physiologists studying the operation of neuronal circuits. We critically review the development of these new probes, and analyze objectives and experimental conditions in which classical probes are likely to prevail and where the fluorescent protein sensors will open paths to previously unexplored territories of functional neuroimaging.},

abstract = {In the early visual system, a contrast gain control mechanism sets the gain of responses based on the locally prevalent contrast. The measure of contrast used by this adaptation mechanism is commonly assumed to be the standard deviation of light intensities relative to the mean (root-mean-square contrast). A number of alternatives, however, are possible. For example, the measure of contrast might depend on the absolute deviations relative to the mean, or on the prevalence of the darkest or lightest intensities. We investigated the statistical computation underlying this measure of contrast in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus, which relays signals from retina to cortex. Borrowing a method from psychophysics, we recorded responses to white noise stimuli whose distribution of intensities was precisely varied. We varied the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution of intensities while keeping the mean luminance constant. We found that gain strongly depends on the standard deviation of the distribution. At constant standard deviation, moreover, gain is invariant to changes in skewness or kurtosis. These findings held for both ON and OFF cells, indicating that the measure of contrast is independent of the range of stimulus intensities signaled by the cells. These results confirm the long-held assumption that contrast gain control computes root-mean-square contrast. They also show that contrast gain control senses the full distribution of intensities and leaves unvaried the relative responses of the different cell types. The advantages to visual processing of this remarkably specific computation are not entirely known.},

abstract = {Reconstruction of white matter tracts based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is currently widely used in clinical research. This reconstruction allows us to identify coordinates of specific white matter tracts and to investigate their anatomy. Fiber reconstruction, however, relies on manual identification of anatomical landmarks of a tract of interest, which is based on subjective judgment and thus a potential source of experimental variability. Here, an automated tract reconstruction approach is introduced. A set of reference regions of interest (rROIs) known to select a tract of interest was marked in our DTI brain atlas. The atlas was then linearly transformed to each subject, and the rROI set was transferred to the subject for tract reconstruction. Agreement between the automated and manual approaches was measured for 11 tracts in 10 healthy volunteers and found to be excellent (kappa>0.8) and remained high up to 4-5 mm of the linear transformation errors. As a first example, the automated approach was applied to brain tumor patients and strategies to cope with severe anatomical abnormalities are discussed.},

the entire spinal cord. Using two-photon imaging, we could monitor

transients were produced by iontophoretic application of glutamate

the application of strychnine. Sensory stimuli that trigger escape

reflexes in mobile zebrafish evoked \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} transients in distinct

neurons of the spinal network. Moreover, long-term recordings revealed

spontaneous \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} transients in individual spinal neurons.

Frequently, this activity occurred synchronously among many neurons

in the network. In conclusion, the new approach permits a reliable

analysis with single-cell resolution of the functional organisation

As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topics.},

abstract = {Prevailing views on how we time the interception of a moving object assume that the visual inputs are informationally sufficient to estimate the time-to-contact from the object's kinematics. Here we present evidence in favor of a different view: the brain makes the best estimate about target motion based on measured kinematics and an a priori guess about the causes of motion. According to this theory, a predictive model is used to extrapolate time-to-contact from expected dynamics (kinetics). We projected a virtual target moving vertically downward on a wide screen with different randomized laws of motion. In the first series of experiments, subjects were asked to intercept this target by punching a real ball that fell hidden behind the screen and arrived in synchrony with the visual target. Subjects systematically timed their motor responses consistent with the assumption of gravity effects on an object's mass, even when the visual target did not accelerate. With training, the gravity model was not switched off but adapted to nonaccelerating targets by shifting the time of motor activation. In the second series of experiments, there was no real ball falling behind the screen. Instead the subjects were required to intercept the visual target by clicking a mousebutton. In this case, subjects timed their responses consistent with the assumption of uniform motion in the absence of forces, even when the target actually accelerated. Overall, the results are in accord with the theory that motor responses evoked by visual kinematics are modulated by a prior of the target dynamics. The prior appears surprisingly resistant to modifications based on performance errors.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of unilateral restricted cochlear lesions in

adult cats on the topographic representations ("maps") of the lesioned

and unlesioned cochleas in the primary auditory cortex (AI) contralateral

to the lesioned cochlea. Frequency (tonotopic) maps were derived

by conventional multineuron mapping procedures in anesthetized animals.

In confirmation of a study in adult guinea pigs (Robertson and Irvine

[1989] J. Comp. Neurol. 282:456-471), we found that 2-11 months after

the unilateral cochlear lesion the map of the lesioned cochlea in

the contralateral AI was altered so that the AI region in which frequencies

with lesion-induced elevations in cochlear neural sensitivity would

have been represented was occupied by an enlarged representation

of lesion-edge frequencies (i.e., frequencies adjacent to those with

elevated cochlear neural sensitivity). Along the tonotopic axis of

AI the total representation of lesion-edge frequencies could extend

up to approximately 2.6 mm rostal to the area of normal representation

of these frequencies. There was no topographic order within this

enlarged representation. Examination of threshold sensitivity at

the characteristic frequency (CF, frequency to which the neurons

were most sensitive) in the reorganized regions of the map of the

lesioned cochlea established that the changes in the map reflected

a plastic reorganization rather than simply reflecting the residue

of prelesion input. In contrast to the change in the map of the lesioned

contralateral cochlea, the map of the unlesioned ipsilateral cochlea

did not differ from those in normal animals. Thus, in contrast to

the normal very good congruency between ipsilateral and contralateral

AI maps, in the lesioned animals ipsilateral and contralateral maps

differed in the region of AI in which there had been a reorganization

of the map of the lesioned cochlea. Outside the region of contralateral

map reorganization, ipsilateral and contralateral AI maps remained

congruent within normal limits. The difference between the two maps

in the region of contralateral map reorganization suggested, in light

of the physiology of binaural interactions in the auditory pathway,

that the cortical reorganization reflected subcortical changes. Finally,

response properties of neuronal clusters within the reorganized map

of the lesioned cochlea were compared to normative data with respect

to threshold sensitivity at CF, the size of frequency "response areas,"

and response latencies. In the majority of cases, CF thresholds were

similar to normative data. The frequency "response areas" were slightly

less sharply tuned than normal, but not significantly. Response latencies

were significantly shorter than normal in three animals and significantly

longer in one animal.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The latest clinical trials indicate better performance
of aromatase inhibitors, compared to tamoxifen, in adjuvant hormonotherapy
of breast carcinoma. The identification of molecular markers, predicting
resistance to tamoxifen, could help to identify patients, which are
most likely to benefit from aromatase inhibitors in up-front adjuvant
hormonotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed
from archival paraffin blocks of primary tumors of 179 patients with
estrogen receptor positive operable breast carcinoma in stage I-III,
subsequently treated with tamoxifen for five years or until relapse,
with at least 7 years follow up available. The amplifications of
Her-2 and cyclin D1 genes were evaluated by fluorescence in-situ
hybridization. The level of progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki67 were
estimated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: 54 of above patients
recurred during follow up. In univariate analysis of disease free
survival, the presence of more than three nodal metastases (RR=4,5
p<0,001), grade 3 (RR=2,3 p=0,035), cyclin D1 (RR=3,06 p<0,001) and
Her-2 (RR=3,06 p<0,001) amplifications were identified as significant
risk factors, together with the negativity of PR (RR=2,1 p=0,013).
In multivariate analysis, only clinical stage III (RR=2,6 p=0,003),
cyclin D1 (RR=2,7 p=0,001) and Her-2 (RR=2,1 p=0,014) amplifications
proved significant. In 77 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy
no statistically significant risk factor was identified. In multivariate
analysis of 102 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy only stage
III (RR=6,9 p=0,001) and Her-2 amplification (RR=4,5 p=0,001) were
confirmed. CONCLUSION: The advanced clinical stage, cyclin D1 and
Her-2 gene amplifications represent factors, predicting the failure
of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, but their predictive value is much
lower in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. This fact indicates,
they can reflect the common biological aggressiveness of tumor and
need not to be tamoxifen specific.},

Post mortem DWI was used to ensure that most of the sources known to degrade the anatomical accuracy of in vivo DWI did not influence the tracking results. We demonstrate that probabilistic tractography reliably detected specific pathways. Moreover, the applied model allowed identification of the limitations that are likely to appear in many of the current tractography methods. Nevertheless, we conclude that DWI tractography can be a precise tool in studying anatomical brain connectivity.},

abstract = {A diffusion deconvolution method is proposed to apply deconvolution to the diffusion orientation distribution function (dODF) and calculate the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF), which is defined as the orientation distribution of the fiber spin density. The dODF can be obtained from q-space imaging methods such as q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), and thus the method can be applied to various diffusion sampling schemes. A phantom study was conducted to compare the angular resolution of the fODF with the dODF, and the in vivo datasets were acquired using single-shell, two-shell, and grid sampling schemes, which were then reconstructed by QBI, GQI, and DSI, respectively. The phantom study showed that the fODF significantly improved the angular resolution over the dODF at 45- and 60-degree crossing angles. The in vivo study showed consistent fODF regardless of the applied sampling schemes and reconstruction methods, and the ability to resolve crossing fibers was improved in reduced sampling condition. The fiber spin density obtained from deconvolution showed a higher contrast-to-noise ratio than the fractional anisotropy (FA) mapping, and further application on tractography showed that the fiber spin density can be used to determine the termination of fiber tracts. In conclusion, the proposed deconvolution method is generally applicable to different q-space imaging methods. The calculated fODF improves the angular resolution and also provides a quantitative index of fiber spin density to refine fiber tracking.},

abstract = {Memories maintained in patterns of synaptic connectivity are rapidly overwritten and destroyed by ongoing plasticity related to the storage of new memories. Short memory lifetimes arise from the bounds that must be imposed on synaptic efficacy in any realistic model. We explored whether memory performance can be improved by allowing synapses to traverse a large number of states before reaching their bounds, or by changing the way these bounds are imposed. In the case of hard bounds, memory lifetimes grow proportional to the square of the number of synaptic states, but only if potentiation and depression are precisely balanced. Improved performance can be obtained without fine tuning by imposing soft bounds, but this improvement is only linear with respect to the number of synaptic states. We explored several other possibilities and conclude that improving memory performance requires a more radical modification of the standard model of memory storage.},

abstract = {In this paper strong limits on the accuracy of real-world physical
computation are established. To derive these results a non-Turing
machine formulation of physical computation is used. First it is
proven that there cannot be a physical computer C to which one can
pose any and all computational tasks concerning the physical universe.
Next it is proven that no physical computer C can correctly carry
out every computational task in the subset of such tasks that could
potentially be posed to C. This means in particular that there cannot
be a physical computer that can be assured of correctly "processing
information faster than the universe does." Because this result holds
independent of how or if the computer is physically coupled to the
rest of the universe, it also means that there cannot exist an infallible,
general-purpose observation apparatus, nor an infallible, general-purpose
control apparatus. These results do not rely on systems that are
infinite, and/or nonclassical, and/or obey chaotic dynamics. They
also hold even if one could use an infinitely fast, infinitely dense
computer, with computational powers greater than that of a Turing
machine (TM). After deriving these results analogs of the TM Halting
theorem are derived for the novel kind of computer considered in
this paper, as are results concerning the (im)possibility of certain
kinds of error-correcting codes. In addition, an analog of algorithmic
information complexity, "prediction complexity," is elaborated. A
task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction complexity
of a computational task can differ for two different reference universal
physical computers used to solve that task. This is analogous to
the "encoding" bound governing how much the algorithm information
complexity of a TM calculation can differ for two reference universal
TMs. It is proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes
a certain type of computation, or prediction complexity is unique
(unlike algorithmic information complexity). Finally, the implications
of this analysis for the issue of whether the universe "is" a computer
are briefly discussed.},

at different portions of the boundary; and it is frequently a challenge
even to select appropriate scales at which to sample the image. This
motivates Bayesian image-match models which are both multiscale and
statistical. We present a novel image-match model for use in Bayesian
segmentation, a multiscale extension of image profile models akin
to those in Active Shape Models. A spherical-harmonic based 3D shape
representation provides a mapping of the object boundary to the sphere
S2, and a scale-space for profiles on the sphere defines a scalespace
on the object. A key feature is that profiles are not blurred across
the object boundary, but only along the boundary. This profile scalespace
is sampled in a coarse-to-fine fashion to produce features for the
statistical image-match model. A framework for model-building and
segmentation has been built, and testing and validation are in progress
with a dataset of 70 segmented images of the caudate nucleus.},

Our method can be seen as a compressing operation, capturing the most meaningful information enclosed in the fiber dataset. For the sake of efficiency, part of the analysis is based on clustering the white matter (WM) voxels rather than the fibers. The resulting regions of interest are used to define subset of fibers that are subdivided further into consistent bundles using a clustering of the fiber extremities. The dataset is reduced from more than one million fiber tracts to about two thousand fiber bundles. Validations are provided using simulated data and a physical phantom. We see our approach as a crucial preprocessing step before further analysis of huge fiber datasets. An important application will be the inference of detailed models of the subdivisions of white matter pathways and the mapping of the main U-fiber bundles.},

abstract = {Learning to perform a behavioural procedure as a well-ingrained habit requires extensive repetition of the behavioural sequence, and learning not to perform such behaviours is notoriously difficult. Yet regaining a habit can occur quickly, with even one or a few exposures to cues previously triggering the behaviour. To identify neural mechanisms that might underlie such learning dynamics, we made long-term recordings from multiple neurons in the sensorimotor striatum, a basal ganglia structure implicated in habit formation, in rats successively trained on a reward-based procedural task, given extinction training and then given reacquisition training. The spike activity of striatal output neurons, nodal points in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, changed markedly across multiple dimensions during each of these phases of learning. First, new patterns of task-related ensemble firing successively formed, reversed and then re-emerged. Second, task-irrelevant firing was suppressed, then rebounded, and then was suppressed again. These changing spike activity patterns were highly correlated with changes in behavioural performance. We propose that these changes in task representation in cortico-basal ganglia circuits represent neural equivalents of the explore-exploit behaviour characteristic of habit learning.},

abstract = {Although motor deficits are common in autism, the neural correlates underlying the disruption of even basic motor execution are unknown. Motor deficits may be some of the earliest identifiable signs of abnormal development and increased understanding of their neural underpinnings may provide insight into autism-associated differences in parallel systems critical for control of more complex behaviour necessary for social and communicative development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine neural activation and connectivity during sequential, appositional finger tapping in 13 children, ages 8-12 years, with high-functioning autism (HFA) and 13 typically developing (TD), age- and sex-matched peers. Both groups showed expected primary activations in cortical and subcortical regions associated with motor execution [contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex, contralateral thalamus, ipsilateral cerebellum, supplementary motor area (SMA)]; however, the TD group showed greater activation in the ipsilateral anterior cerebellum, while the HFA group showed greater activation in the SMA. Although activation differences were limited to a subset of regions, children with HFA demonstrated diffusely decreased connectivity across the motor execution network relative to control children. The between-group dissociation of cerebral and cerebellar motor activation represents the first neuroimaging data of motor dysfunction in children with autism, providing insight into potentially abnormal circuits impacting development. Decreased cerebellar activation in the HFA group may reflect difficulty shifting motor execution from cortical regions associated with effortful control to regions associated with habitual execution. Additionally, diffusely decreased connectivity may reflect poor coordination within the circuit necessary for automating patterned motor behaviour. The findings might explain impairments in motor development in autism, as well as abnormal and delayed acquisition of gestures important for socialization and communication.},

abstract = {The number of receptors opening after glutamate release is critical

for understanding the sources of noise and the dynamic range of synaptic

transmission. We imaged [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}] transients mediated by synaptically

activated NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) in individual spines in rat brain

slices. We show that \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} influx through single NMDA-Rs can

be reliably detected, allowing us to estimate the number of receptors

opening after synaptic transmission. This number is small: at the

peak of the synaptic response, less than one NMDA-R is open, on average.

Therefore, stochastic interactions between transmitter and receptor

contribute substantially to synaptic noise, and glutamate occupies

a small fraction of receptors. The number of receptors opening did

not scale with spine volume, and smaller spines experience larger

[\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}] transients during synaptic transmission. Our measurements

further demonstrate that optical recordings can be used to study

single receptors in intact systems.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of multiunit recordings gives new urgency to the need for effective analysis of "multidimensional" time-series data that are derived from the recorded activity of neuronal ensembles in the form of multiple sequences of action potentials--treated mathematically as point-processes and computationally as spike-trains. Whether in conditions of spontaneous activity or under conditions of external stimulation, the objective is the identification and quantification of possible causal links among the neurons generating the observed binary signals. A multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) modeling methodology is presented that can be used to quantify the neuronal dynamics of causal interrelationships in neuronal ensembles using spike-train data recorded from individual neurons. These causal interrelationships are modeled as transformations of spike-trains recorded from a set of neurons designated as the "inputs" into spike-trains recorded from another set of neurons designated as the "outputs." The MIMO model is composed of a set of multiinput/single-output (MISO) modules, one for each output. Each module is the cascade of a MISO Volterra model and a threshold operator generating the output spikes. The Laguerre expansion approach is used to estimate the Volterra kernels of each MISO module from the respective input-output data using the least-squares method. The predictive performance of the model is evaluated with the use of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, from which the optimum threshold is also selected. The Mann-Whitney statistic is used to select the significant inputs for each output by examining the statistical significance of improvements in the predictive accuracy of the model when the respective inputs is included. Illustrative examples are presented for a simulated system and for an actual application using multiunit data recordings from the hippocampus of a behaving rat.},

abstract = {1. Intracellular recordings were made from the dorsal cochlear nucleus

(DCN) in slices of the cochlear nuclear complex. Probably the larger

and most frequent cells were impaled. 2. The steady-state current-voltage

(I-V) properties of all cells impaled were nonlinear. The I-V curve

was steepest in the voltage range depolarized from the resting potential

and most shallow when the cell was hyperpolarized from rest by more

than about 10 mV. Thus, the inwardly rectifying I-V characteristics

of cells in the DCN distinguish them from those of ventral cochlear

nuclear neurones (Oertel, 1983). 3. When depolarized with current,

most cells fired trains of large, all-or-none action potentials.

The undershoot after single spikes comprised an initial, fast component

followed by a second, slower wave. A few cells (15\%) generated bursts

of smaller, graded spikes in addition to the large ones. 4. Repetitive

firing evoked by depolarizing pulses of current was followed by an

after-hyperpolarization whose magnitude depended on the strength

and duration of the preceding current pulse. 5. Blocking the large

action potentials with tetrodotoxin (TTX) revealed Ca2+-dependent

spikes in all cells examined. 6. The steady-state I-V relationship

became linear in the presence of TTX, suggesting that a persistent

Na+ conductance probably mediates the inward rectification seen above

the resting potential. 7. Muscarine at micromolar concentrations

the structure and function of biological specimens. Although numerous

commercial laser scanning microscopes exist, some of the more interesting

and challenging applications demand custom design. A major impediment

to custom design is the difficulty of building custom data acquisition

hardware and writing the complex software required to run the laser

scanning microscope. RESULTS: We describe a simple, software-based

approach to operating a laser scanning microscope without the need

for custom data acquisition hardware. Data acquisition and control

of laser scanning are achieved through standard data acquisition

boards. The entire burden of signal integration and image processing

is placed on the CPU of the computer. We quantitate the effectiveness

of our data acquisition and signal conditioning algorithm under a

variety of conditions. We implement our approach in an open source

software package (ScanImage) and describe its functionality. CONCLUSIONS:

We present ScanImage, software to run a flexible laser scanning microscope

that allows easy custom design.},

The results from these studies suggest that humans are endowed with genetic variation that influences the decision to invest, and to reciprocate investment, in the classic trust game.

In this paper we develop appropriate techniques for analysis and visualization of such imaging data to separate the signal from the noise and characterize the signal. The techniques developed fall into the general category of multivariate time series analysis, and in particular we extensively use the multitaper framework of spectral analysis. We develop specific protocols for the analysis of fMRI, optical imaging, and MEG data, and illustrate the techniques by applications to real data sets generated by these imaging modalities. In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct stages: "noise" characterization and suppression, and "signal" characterization and visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is the utility of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving analysis windows to account for nonstationarity in the data. Of particular note are 1) the development of a decomposition technique (space-frequency singular value decomposition) that is shown to be a useful means of characterizing the image data, and 2) the development of an algorithm, based on multitaper methods, for the removal of approximately periodic physiological artifacts arising from cardiac and respiratory sources.},

abstract = {The function of the cerebral cortex is dependent on the precise organization of the circuits formed by its component neurons. The connections between neurons are not random, but are specific at multiple levels of organization. For example, each cortical area connects to only a selected subset of other areas and within any given area the axonal and dendritic arbors of individual neurons arborize in precise, layer-specific patterns (for review see Felleman \& Van Essen, 1991; Callaway, 1998). In each layer there are dendrites from multiple cell types including cells with somata both within and outside that layer. Anatomical studies have shown that axons arborizing in a particular cortical layer can connect selectively onto dendrites of some cell types in the layer, while avoiding the dendrites of other cell types (e.g. Freund \& Gulyas, 1991; Hornung \& Celio, 1992; Staiger et al., 1996). These cell type specific connections are, however, difficult to elucidate with anatomical methods, so the frequency of such specificity has remained elusive. Recent experimental methods combining intracellular recording of single neurons with focal neuronal stimulation by uncaging glutamate with light ("photostimulation") have made the analysis of cell type specific cortical connections more tractable. These studies show that cell type specificity of connections is prevalent in cortex. Here I review photostimulation-based studies investigating the laminar sources of cortical input to distinct cell types in the visual and somatosensory cortices of rats and the primary visual cortex of monkeys.},

abstract = {A central hypothesis concerning sensory processing is that the neuronal circuits are specifically adapted to represent natural stimuli efficiently. Here we show a novel effect in cortical coding of natural images. Using spike-triggered average or spike-triggered covariance analyses, we first identified the visual features selectively represented by each cortical neuron from its responses to natural images. We then measured the neuronal sensitivity to these features when they were present in either natural images or random stimuli. We found that in the responses of complex cells, but not of simple cells, the sensitivity was markedly higher for natural images than for random stimuli. Such elevated sensitivity leads to increased detectability of the visual features and thus an improved cortical representation of natural scenes. Interestingly, this effect is due not to the spatial power spectra of natural images, but to their phase regularities. These results point to a distinct visual-coding strategy that is mediated by contextual modulation of cortical responses tuned to the spatial-phase structure of natural scenes.},

abstract = {We describe a class of models that predict how the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron depends on a dynamic stimulus. The models utilize a learnt pointwise nonlinear transform of the stimulus, followed by a linear filter that acts on the sequence of transformed inputs. In one case, the nonlinear transform is the same at all filter lag-times. Thus, this "input nonlinearity" converts the initial numerical representation of stimulus value to a new representation that provides optimal input to the subsequent linear model. We describe algorithms that estimate both the input nonlinearity and the linear weights simultaneously; and present techniques to regularise and quantify uncertainty in the estimates. In a second approach, the model is generalized to allow a different nonlinear transform of the stimulus value at each lag-time. Although more general, this model is algorithmically more straightforward to fit. However, it has many more degrees of freedom than the first approach, thus requiring more data for accurate estimation. We test the feasibility of these methods on synthetic data, and on responses from a neuron in rodent barrel cortex. The models are shown to predict responses to novel data accurately, and to recover several important neuronal response properties.},

To solve the partitioning problem, we use a new spectral co-clustering algorithm that uses the second left and right singular vectors of an appropriately scaled word-document matrix to yield good bipartitionings. The spectral algorithm enjoys some optimality properties; it can be shown that the singular vectors solve a real relaxation to the NP-complete graph bipartitioning problem.

In the present paper, we evaluate our understanding of cortical activated states from a computational neuroscience point of view. We start by reviewing the electrophysiological characteristics of activated cortical states based on recordings and analysis performed in awake cat association cortex. These analyses show that cortical activity is characterized by an apparent Poisson-distributed stochastic dynamics, both at the single-cell and population levels, and that single cells display a high-conductance state dominated by inhibition. We next overview computational models of the "awake" cortex, and perform the same analyses as in the experiments. Many properties identified experimentally are indeed reproduced by models, such as depolarized V(m), irregular firing with apparent Poisson statistics, and the determinant role of inhibitory fluctuations on spiking. However, other features are not well reproduced, such as firing statistics and the conductance state of the membrane, suggesting that the network state displayed by models is not entirely correct. We also show how networks can approach a correct conductance state, suggesting ways by which future models will generate activity fully consistent with experimental data.},

abstract = {Whole brain network analysis of diffusion imaging tractography data is an important new tool for quantification of differential connectivity signatures across individuals and between groups. Here we investigate both the conservation of network architectural properties across methodological variation and the reproducibility of individual architecture across multiple scanning sessions. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were both acquired in triplicate from a cohort of healthy young adults. Deterministic tractography was performed on each dataset and inter-regional connectivity matrices were then derived by applying each of three widely used whole brain parcellation schemes over a range of spatial resolutions. Across acquisitions and preprocessing streams, anatomical brain networks were found to be sparsely connected, hierarchical, and assortative. They also displayed signatures of topo-physical interdependence such as Rentian scaling. Basic connectivity properties and several graph metrics consistently displayed high reproducibility and low variability in both DSI and DTI networks. The relative increased sensitivity of DSI to complex fiber configurations was evident in increased tract counts and network density compared with DTI. In combination, this pattern of results shows that network analysis of human white matter connectivity provides sensitive and temporally stable topological and physical estimates of individual cortical structure across multiple spatial scales.},

abstract = {We present a method for studying synaptic transmission in mass cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons based on patch clamp recording combined with laser stimulation of neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Our goal was to use the high spatial resolution of laser illumination to come as close as possible to the ideal of identifying monosynaptically coupled pairs of neurons, which is conventionally done using microisland rather than mass cultures. Using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to deliver the ChR2 gene, we focused on the time period between 14 and 20 days in vitro, during which expression levels are high, and spontaneous bursting activity has not yet started. Stimulation by wide-field illumination is sufficient to make the majority of ChR2-expressing neurons spike. Stimulation with a laser spot at least 10 microm in diameter also produces action potentials, but in a reduced fraction of neurons. We studied synaptic transmission by voltage-clamping a neuron with low expression of ChR2 and scanning a 40 microm laser spot at surrounding locations. Responses were observed to stimulation at a subset of locations in the culture, indicating spatial localization of stimulation. Pharmacological means were used to identify responses that were synaptic. Many responses were of smaller amplitude than those typically found in microisland cultures. We were unable to find an entirely reliable criterion for distinguishing between monosynaptic and polysynaptic responses. However, we propose that postsynaptic currents with small amplitudes, simple shapes, and latencies not much greater than 8 ms are reasonable candidates for monosynaptic interactions.},

abstract = {The analysis of cell signaling requires the rapid and selective manipulation of protein function. We have synthesized photoswitches that covalently modify target proteins and reversibly present and withdraw a ligand from its binding site due to photoisomerization of an azobenzene linker. We describe here the properties of a glutamate photoswitch that controls an ion channel in cells. Affinity labeling and geometric constraints ensure that the photoswitch controls only the targeted channel, and enables spatial patterns of light to favor labeling in one location over another. Photoswitching to the activating state places a tethered glutamate at a high (millimolar) effective local concentration near the binding site. The fraction of active channels can be set in an analog manner by altering the photostationary state with different wavelengths. The bistable photoswitch can be turned on with millisecond-long pulses at one wavelength, remain on in the dark for minutes, and turned off with millisecond long pulses at the other wavelength, yielding sustained activation with minimal irradiation. The system provides rapid, reversible remote control of protein function that is selective without orthogonal chemistry.},

@article{VP09_super,
abstract = {The "mind-brain supervenience" conjecture suggests that all mental properties (e.g. consciousness, intelligence, personality, etc.) are derived from the physical properties of the brain. The validity of this conjecture has been argued in philosophical terms for over 2,500 years. Alternative conjectures, including various non-physical causes of mental properties, seem rather implausible to many, but proving or disproving these alternatives has remained elusive. To address the question of whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we here frame a supervenience hypothesis in rigorous mathematical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified version of supervenience (called epsilon-supervenience) that is amenable to experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided determination of epsilon-supervenience. The physical property of the brain employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the brain-graph or connectome). Epsilon-supervenience allows us to determine whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to within any given misclassification rate > 0, regardless of the relationship between the two. To the philosopher, this work shows how philosophical conjectures can be transformed into statistical hypotheses that are amenable experimental investigation. This allows the philosopher to gain empirical support for her rational arguments. To the statistician, this work points out the limitations of hypothesis testing; and suggests that some of these limitations have not previously been fully appreciated. To the neuroscientist, this work indicates that much of contemporary research can be framed in terms of investigating supervenience. This should provide further motivation for cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statistical graphtheoreticians.},

abstract = {The neural basis of behavioral choice in vertebrates remains largely unknown. Zebrafish larvae have a defined locomotor repertoire as well as a simple nervous system and are therefore an attractive vertebrate system in which to study this process. Here we describe a high-throughput system for quantifying the kinematics of motor events in zebrafish larvae in order to measure the initiation frequency of different maneuvers. We use this system to analyze responses to photic stimuli and find that larvae respond to changes in illumination with both acute responses and extended behavioral programs. Reductions in illumination elicit large angle turns, distinct from startle responses, which orient larvae toward the source of light. In continuing darkness, larvae are transiently hyperactive before adopting a quiescent state. Indeed, locomotor activity is controlled by the state of light or dark adaptation similar to masking phenomena in higher vertebrates where light directly regulates motor activity. We propose that regulation of motor activity by photic stimuli in zebrafish larvae serves a behavioral goal of maximizing exposure to well lit environments optimal for feeding.},

abstract = {In CNS neurons most of synaptic integration takes place in thin dendritic branches that are difficult to study with conventional physiological recording techniques (electrodes). When cellular compartments are too small, or too many, for electrode recordings, optical methods bring considerable advantages. Here we focused our experimental effort on the development and utilization of new kinds of voltage-sensitive dyes (VSD). The new VSDs have bluish appearance in organic solvents, and hence are dubbed "blue dyes". They have preferred excitation windows for voltage recording that are shifted to longer wavelengths (approximately 660nm). Excitation in deep red light and emission in the near-infrared render "blue VSDs" potentially useful in measurements from fluorescent structures below the tissue surface because light scattering is minimized at longer wavelengths. Seven new molecules were systematically tested using intracellular injection. In comparison to the previously used red dye (JPW-3028) the blue dyes have better sensitivity (DeltaF/F) by approximately 40\%. Blue dyes take little time to fill the dendritic tree, and in this aspect they are comparable with the fastest red dye JPW-3028. Based on our results, blue VSDs are well suited for experimental exploration of thin neuronal processes in semi intact preparations (brain slice). In some cases only six sweeps of temporal averaging were needed to acquire excellent records of individual action potentials in basal and oblique dendritic branches, or in axons and axon collaterals up to 200microm away from the cell body. Signal-to-noise ratio of these recordings was approximately 10. The combination of blue dyes and laser illumination approach imposed little photodynamic damage and allowed the total number of recording sweeps per cell to exceed 100. Using these dyes and a spot laser illumination technique, we demonstrate the first recording of action potentials in the oblique dendrite and distal axonal segment of the same pyramidal cell.},

abstract = {As recent advances in calcium sensing technologies facilitate simultaneously
imaging action potentials in neuronal populations, complementary
analytical tools must also be developed to maximize the utility of
this experimental paradigm. Although the observations here are fluorescence
movies, the signals of interest--spike trains and/or time varying
intracellular calcium concentrations--are hidden. Inferring these
hidden signals is often problematic due to noise, nonlinearities,
slow imaging rate, and unknown biophysical parameters. We overcome
these difficulties by developing sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle
filters) based on biophysical models of spiking, calcium dynamics,
and fluorescence. We show that even in simple cases, the particle
filters outperform the optimal linear (i.e., Wiener) filter, both
by obtaining better estimates and by providing error bars. We then
relax a number of our model assumptions to incorporate nonlinear
saturation of the fluorescence signal, as well external stimulus
and spike history dependence (e.g., refractoriness) of the spike
trains. Using both simulations and in vitro fluorescence observations,
we demonstrate temporal superresolution by inferring when within
a frame each spike occurs. Furthermore, the model parameters may
be estimated using expectation maximization with only a very limited
amount of data (e.g., approximately 5-10 s or 5-40 spikes), without
the requirement of any simultaneous electrophysiology or imaging

abstract = {Pyramidal cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) show three distinct

temporal discharge patterns in response to sound: "pauser," "buildup,"

and "chopper." Similar discharge patterns are seen in vitro and depend

on the voltage from which the cell is depolarized. It has been proposed

that an inactivating A-type K+ current (IKI) might play a critical

role in generating the three different patterns. In this study we

examined the characteristics of transient currents in DCN pyramidal

cells to evaluate this hypothesis. Morphologically identified pyramidal

cells in rat brain slices (P11-P17) exhibited the three voltage-dependent

discharge patterns. Two inactivating currents were present in outside-out

patches from pyramidal cells: a rapidly inactivating (IKIF, tau approximately

11 msec) current insensitive to block by tetraethylammonium (TEA)

and variably blocked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) with half-inactivation

near -85 mV, and a slowly inactivating TEA- and 4-AP-sensitive current

(IKIS, tau approximately 145 msec) with half-inactivation near -35

mV. Recovery from inactivation at 34 degrees C was described by a

single exponential with a time constant of 10-30 msec, similar to

the rate at which first spike latency increases with the duration

of a hyperpolarizing prepulse. Acutely isolated cells also possessed

a rapidly activating (<1 msec at 22 degrees C) transient current

that activated near -45 mV and showed half-inactivation near -80

mV. A model demonstrated that the deinactivation of IKIF was correlated

with the discharge patterns. Overall, the properties of the fast

inactivating K+ current were consistent with their proposed role

in shaping the discharge pattern of DCN pyramidal cells.},

to be a secretory glycoprotein implicated in cellular growth and

lack an N-terminal peptide present in the secreted form of the protein.
In contrast to normal cells, CREG is largely secreted by fibroblasts
missing both mannose 6-phosphate receptors. This is not observed
in cells lacking only one of them. Mass spectrometric analysis of
recombinant CREG revealed that the protein contains phosphorylated
oligosaccharides at either of its two N-glycosylation sites. Cellular
CREG was found to cosediment with lysosomal markers upon subcellular
fractionation by density-gradient centrifugation. In fibroblasts
expressing a CREG-GFP fusion construct, the heterologous protein
was detected in compartments containing lysosomal proteins. Immunolocalization
of endogenous CREG confirmed that intracellular CREG is localized

the action of lysosomal cysteine proteinases. These results establish
that CREG is a lysosomal protein that undergoes proteolytic maturation
in the course of its biosynthesis, carries the mannose 6-phosphate
recognition marker and depends on the interaction with mannose 6-phosphate
receptors for efficient delivery to lysosomes.},

abstract = {We readdress the diffusion tractography problem in a global and probabilistic manner. Instead of tracking through local orientations, we parameterise the connexions between brain regions at a global level, and then infer on global and local parameters simultaneously in a Bayesian framework. This approach offers a number of important benefits. The global nature of the tractography reduces sensitivity to local noise and modelling errors. By constraining tractography to ensure a connexion is found, and then inferring on the exact location of the connexion, we increase the robustness of connectivity-based parcellations, allowing parcellations of connexions that were previously invisible to tractography. The Bayesian framework allows a direct comparison of the evidence for connecting and non-connecting models, to test whether the connexion is supported by the data. Crucially, by explicit parameterisation of the connexion between brain regions, we infer on a parameter that is shared with models of functional connectivity. This model is a first step toward the joint inference on functional and anatomical connectivity.},

neurons, were contacted by axosomatic, axodendritic and axospinous

dendritic filopodia were more abundant during the early stages of
maturation and, when analyzed in three dimensions, the tips of all
filopodia were found within 200 nm of preexisting boutons that already
synapsed on other neurons. Furthermore, dendritic spines primarily
synapsed on multiple-synapse boutons, suggesting that initial contacts
were preferentially made with preexisting boutons already involved
in a synapse. The connectivity of new neurons continued to change
until at least 2 months, long after the formation of the first dendritic
protrusions.},

abstract = {We propose an integral concept for tractography to describe crossing and splitting fibre bundles based on the fibre orientation distribution function (ODF) estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We show that in order to perform accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT provides new insight into the relationship between the HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical spherical deconvolution and improves the angular resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of this paper is the development of new deterministic and new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the full multidirectional information obtained through use of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is performed on human brain datasets comparing our new deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an application of our new probabilistic tracking, we quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects. Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to incorrect interpretations of brain functions.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions.},

We assessed white matter integrity voxelwise using diffusion tensor imaging at high magnetic field (4 Tesla), in 92 identical and fraternal twins. White matter integrity, quantified using fractional anisotropy (FA), was used to fit structural equation models (SEM) at each point in the brain, generating three-dimensional maps of heritability. We visualized the anatomical profile of correlations between white matter integrity and full-scale, verbal, and performance intelligence quotients (FIQ, VIQ, and PIQ). White matter integrity (FA) was under strong genetic control and was highly heritable in bilateral frontal (a(2)=0.55, p=0.04, left; a(2)=0.74, p=0.006, right), bilateral parietal (a(2)=0.85, p<0.001, left; a(2)=0.84, p<0.001, right), and left occipital (a(2)=0.76, p=0.003) lobes, and was correlated with FIQ and PIQ in the cingulum, optic radiations, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, internal capsule, callosal isthmus, and the corona radiata (p=0.04 for FIQ and p=0.01 for PIQ, corrected for multiple comparisons). In a cross-trait mapping approach, common genetic factors mediated the correlation between IQ and white matter integrity, suggesting a common physiological mechanism for both, and common genetic determination. These genetic brain maps reveal heritable aspects of white matter integrity and should expedite the discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting fiber connectivity and cognition.},

An expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm is derived for learning the parameters of the model, and the model is related to previous works in linear systems, machine learning, time-series clustering, control theory, and computer vision. Through experimentation, it is shown that the mixture of dynamic textures is a suitable representation for both the appearance and dynamics of a variety of visual processes that have traditionally been challenging for computer vision (e.g. fire, steam, water, vehicle and pedestrian traffic, etc.). When compared with state-of-the-art methods in motion segmentation, including both temporal texture methods and traditional representations (e.g. optical flow or other localized motion representations), the mixture of dynamic textures achieves superior performance in the problems of clustering and segmenting video of such processes.},

abstract = {In recent years, neuroimaging studies have increasingly been acquiring multiple modalities of data and searching for task- or disease-related changes in each modality separately. A major challenge in analysis is to find systematic approaches for fusing these differing data types together to automatically find patterns of related changes across multiple modalities, when they exist. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular unsupervised learning method that can be used to find the modes of variation in neuroimaging data across a group of subjects. When multimodal data is acquired for the subjects, ICA is typically performed separately on each modality, leading to incompatible decompositions across modalities. Using a modular Bayesian framework, we develop a novel "Linked ICA" model for simultaneously modelling and discovering common features across multiple modalities, which can potentially have completely different units, signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, voxel counts, spatial smoothnesses and intensity distributions. Furthermore, this general model can be configured to allow tensor ICA or spatially-concatenated ICA decompositions, or a combination of both at the same time. Linked ICA automatically determines the optimal weighting of each modality, and also can detect single-modality structured components when present. This is a fully probabilistic approach, implemented using Variational Bayes. We evaluate the method on simulated multimodal data sets, as well as on a real data set of Alzheimer's patients and age-matched controls that combines two very different types of structural MRI data: morphological data (grey matter density) and diffusion data (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and tensor mode).},

abstract = {The neurons in the mammalian (gerbil, cat) dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) have responses to tones and noise that have been used to classify them into unit types. These types (I-V) are based on excitatory and inhibitory responses to tones organized into plots called response maps (RMs). Type I units show purely excitatory responses, while type V units are primarily inhibited. A computational model of the neural circuitry of the mammalian DCN, based on the MacGregor neuromime, was used to investigate RMs of the principal cells (P-cells) that represent the fusiform and giant cells. In gerbils, fusiform cells have been shown to have primarily type III unit response properties; however, fusiform cells in the cat DCN are thought to have type IV unit response properties. The DCN model is based on a previous computational model of the cat (Hancock and Voigt Ann Biomed Eng 27: 73-87, 1999) and gerbil (Zheng and Voigt Ann Biomed Eng 34: 697-708, 2006) DCN. The basic model for both species is architecturally the same, and to get either type III unit RMs or type IV unit RMs, connection parameters were adjusted. Interestingly, regardless of the RM type, these units in gerbils and cats show spectral notch sensitivity and are thought to play a role in sound localization in the median plane. In this study, further parameter adjustments were made to systematically explore their effect on P-cell RMs. Significantly, type I, type III, type III-i, type IV, type IV-T and type V unit RMs can be created for the modeled P-cells. Thus major RMs observed in the cat and gerbil DCN are recreated by the model. These results suggest that RMs of individual DCN projection neurons are the result of specific assortment of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to that neuron and that subtle differences in the complement of inputs can result in different RM types. Modulation of the efficacy of certain synapses suggests that RM type may change dynamically.},

abstract = {Intuitively, higher intelligence might be assumed to correspond to more efficient information transfer in the brain, but no direct evidence has been reported from the perspective of brain networks. In this study, we performed extensive analyses to test the hypothesis that individual differences in intelligence are associated with brain structural organization, and in particular that higher scores on intelligence tests are related to greater global efficiency of the brain anatomical network. We constructed binary and weighted brain anatomical networks in each of 79 healthy young adults utilizing diffusion tensor tractography and calculated topological properties of the networks using a graph theoretical method. Based on their IQ test scores, all subjects were divided into general and high intelligence groups and significantly higher global efficiencies were found in the networks of the latter group. Moreover, we showed significant correlations between IQ scores and network properties across all subjects while controlling for age and gender. Specifically, higher intelligence scores corresponded to a shorter characteristic path length and a higher global efficiency of the networks, indicating a more efficient parallel information transfer in the brain. The results were consistently observed not only in the binary but also in the weighted networks, which together provide convergent evidence for our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of brain structural organization may be an important biological basis for intelligence.},

@article{Raphan2010,
abstract = {Selection of an optimal estimator typically relies on either supervised training samples (pairs of measurements and their associated true values) or a prior probability model for the true values. Here, we consider the problem of obtaining a least squares estimator given a measurement process with known statistics (i.e., a likelihood function) and a set of unsupervised measurements, each arising from a corresponding true value drawn randomly from an unknown distribution. We develop a general expression for a nonparametric empirical Bayes least squares (NEBLS) estimator, which expresses the optimal least squares estimator in terms of the measurement density, with no explicit reference to the unknown (prior) density. We study the conditions under which such estimators exist and derive specific forms for a variety of different measurement processes. We further show that each of these NEBLS estimators may be used to express the mean squared estimation error as an expectation over the measurement density alone, thus generalizing Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which provides such an expression for the additive gaussian noise case. This error expression may then be optimized over noisy measurement samples, in the absence of supervised training data, yielding a generalized SURE-optimized parametric least squares (SURE2PLS) estimator. In the special case of a linear parameterization (i.e., a sum of nonlinear kernel functions), the objective function is quadratic, and we derive an incremental form for learning this estimator from data. We also show that combining the NEBLS form with its corresponding generalized SURE expression produces a generalization of the score-matching procedure for parametric density estimation. Finally, we have implemented several examples of such estimators, and we show that their performance is comparable to their optimal Bayesian or supervised regression counterparts for moderate to large amounts of data.},

Although massively parallel sequencing instruments are in principle well suited to this task, the error rates in such instruments are generally too high to allow confident identification of rare variants. We here describe an approach that can substantially increase the sensitivity of massively parallel sequencing instruments for this purpose. The keys to this approach, called the Safe-Sequencing System ("Safe-SeqS"), are (i) assignment of a unique identifier (UID) to each template molecule, (ii) amplification of each uniquely tagged template molecule to create UID families, and (iii) redundant sequencing of the amplification products. PCR fragments with the same UID are considered mutant ("supermutants") only if ≥95\% of them contain the identical mutation. We illustrate the utility of this approach for determining the fidelity of a polymerase, the accuracy of oligonucleotides synthesized in vitro, and the prevalence of mutations in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of normal cells.},

data of the one which is nearest to a given target item with respect
to a distance function. Our goal is to find fast search algorithms
which are full-search equivalent - that is, the resulting match is
as good as what we could obtain if we were to search the set exhaustively.
We propose a framework made up of three components, namely (i) a
technique for obtaining a good initial match, (ii) an inexpensive
method for determining whether the current match is a full-search
equivalent match, and (iii) an effective technique for improving
the current match. Our approach is to consider good solutions for
each component in order to find an algorithm which balances the overall
complexity of the search. We also propose a technique for hierarchical
ordering and cluster elimination using a minimal cost spanning tree.
Our experiments on vector quantisation coding of images show that
the framework and techniques we proposed can be used to construct
suitable algorithms for most of our data sets which require full-search
equivalent matches at an average arithmetic cost of less than O(k

Here we describe an optical stimulation method based on semi-synthetic light-activated ion channels. These SPARK (synthetic photoisomerizable azobenzene-regulated K(+)) channels consist of a synthetic azobenzene-containing photoswitch and a genetically modified Shaker K(+) channel protein. SPARK channels with a wild-type selectivity filter elicit hyperpolarization and suppress action potential firing when activated by 390 nm light. A mutation in the pore converts the K(+)-selective Shaker channel into a nonselective cation channel. Activation of this modified channel with the same wavelength of light elicits depolarization of the membrane potential. Expression of these depolarizing SPARK channels in neurons allows light to rapidly and reversibly trigger action potential firing. Hence, hyper- and depolarizing SPARK channels provide a means for eliciting opposite effects on neurons in response to the same light stimulus.},

We apply independent component analysis (ICA) to simulated cone responses to natural scenes, obtaining a set of colored independent component (IC) filters that form a redundancy-reducing visual code. We compare IC filters with physiologically measured V1 neurons, and find great spatial similarity between IC filters and V1 simple cells. On cursory inspection, there is little chromatic similarity; however, we find that many apparent differences result from biases in the physiological measurements and ICA analysis. After correcting these biases, we find that the chromatic tuning of IC filters does indeed resemble the population of V1 neurons, supporting the redundancy-reduction hypothesis.},

abstract = {High spatial resolution and low risks of photodamage make two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (TPLSM) the method of choice for biological imaging. However, the study of functional dynamics such as neuronal calcium regulation often also requires a high temporal resolution. Hitherto, acquisition speed is usually increased by line scanning, which restricts spatial resolution to structures along a single axis. To overcome this gap between high spatial and high temporal resolution we performed TPLSM with a beam multiplexer to generate multiple laser foci inside the sample. By detecting the fluorescence emitted from these laser foci with an electron-multiplying camera, it was possible to perform multiple simultaneous linescans. In addition to multiline scanning, the array of up to 64 laser beams could also be used in x-y scan mode to collect entire images at high frame rates. To evaluate the applicability of multiline TPLSM to functional in vivo imaging, calcium signals were monitored in visual motion-sensitive neurons in the brain of flies. The capacity of our method to simultaneously acquire signals at different cellular locations is exemplified by measurements at branched neurites and 'spine'-like structures. Calcium dynamics depended on branch size, but 'spines' did not systematically differ from their 'parent neurites'. The spatial resolution of our setup was critically evaluated by comparing it to confocal microscopy and the negative effect of scattering of emission light during image detection was assessed directly by running the setup in both imaging and point-scanning mode.},

abstract = {A central hypothesis concerning sensory processing is that the neuronal circuits are specifically adapted to represent natural stimuli efficiently. Here we show a novel effect in cortical coding of natural images. Using spike-triggered average or spike-triggered covariance analyses, we first identified the visual features selectively represented by each cortical neuron from its responses to natural images. We then measured the neuronal sensitivity to these features when they were present in either natural images or random stimuli. We found that in the responses of complex cells, but not of simple cells, the sensitivity was markedly higher for natural images than for random stimuli. Such elevated sensitivity leads to increased detectability of the visual features and thus an improved cortical representation of natural scenes. Interestingly, this effect is due not to the spatial power spectra of natural images, but to their phase regularities. These results point to a distinct visual-coding strategy that is mediated by contextual modulation of cortical responses tuned to the spatial-phase structure of natural scenes.},

The clustering of stationary data by the proposed algorithm is comparable to the other popular algorithms tested (batch and on-line). The second issue addressed is the number of clusters required to represent the data. The algorithm provides an efficient framework to determine the natural number of clusters given the scale of the problem. Finally, the proposed algorithm implicitly minimizes the local distortion, a measure that takes into account clusters with relatively small mass. In contrast, most existing on-line clustering methods assume stationarity of the data. When used to cluster nonstationary data, these methods fail to generate a good representation. Moreover, most current algorithms are computationally intensive when determining the correct number of clusters. These algorithms tend to neglect clusters of small mass due to their minimization of the global distortion (Energy).},

a versatile approach for loading \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} indicators in vivo by

local electroporation. With this method, \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} imaging can

be performed both at neuron population level and with exquisite subcellular

resolution down to dendritic spines and axon boutons. This enabled

mitral cell odor-evoked ensemble activity to be analyzed simultaneously

with revealing their specific connectivity to different glomeruli.

Colabeling of Purkinje cell dendrites and intersecting parallel fibers

allowed \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} imaging of both presynaptic boutons and postsynaptic

dendrites. This approach thus provides an unprecedented capability

for in vivo visualizing active cell ensembles and tracing their underlying

local neuronal circuits.},

It has been proposed that olfactory bulb mitral cells exhibit this functional circuitry, with excitation from one glomerulus and inhibition from a broad field of glomeruli within reach of the lateral dendrites. We investigated this hypothesis using a combination of in vivo intrinsic imaging, single-unit recording, and a large panel of odors. Assuming a broad inhibitory field, a mitral cell would be influenced by >100 contiguous glomeruli and should respond to many odors. Instead, the observed response rate was an order of magnitude lower. A quantitative model indicates that mitral cell responses can be explained by just a handful of glomeruli. These glomeruli are spatially dispersed on the bulb and represent a broad range of odor sensitivities. We conclude that mitral cells do not have center-surround receptive fields. Instead, each mitral cell performs a specific computation combining a small and diverse set of glomerular inputs.},

Here, we introduce two bright green fluorescent RSFPs, bsDronpa and Padron, generated by extensive mutagenesis of the RSFP Dronpa, with unique absorption and switching characteristics. Whereas bsDronpa features a broad absorption spectrum extending into the UV, Padron displays a switching behavior that is reversed to that of all green fluorescent RSFPs known to date. These two RSFPs enable live-cell fluorescence microscopy with multiple labels using a single detection color, because they can be distinguished by photoswitching. Furthermore, we demonstrate dual-color fluorescence microscopy with sub-diffraction resolution using bsDronpa and Dronpa whose emission maxima are separated by <20 nm.},

abstract = {A court-sworn medical expert is sometimes authorized to pass a medical
judgement, whether an older, from serious diseases suffering accused
is able to take part in the criminal trial proceedings. The court-sworn
medical expert is required to consider the accused's fitness, his
mental and physical ability to appear in court, to understand the
trial, to answer the questions of the judge, to defend himself, to
put questions and objections against the witness's testimony, etc.
Such medical expert's opinion is usually a task for a psychiatrist.
Judgement of the ability of the accused to take part in the main
court trial is of another character, especially when the accused
is suffering from a serious disease, e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary,
gastrointestinal, haematological, tumorous or other. In this case
the medical judgement is usually required from a doctor of internal
medicine. Nevertheless, this is not an easy task for him. As far
as these problems are concerned, the expert gathers only little experience
of his own during his juridical practice. Similar cases have been
extremely sporadically published in medical or juridical literature
and if, then in common sense only. It is evident that the expert
must face any possible aggravation of the accused's difficulties.
At the same time the expert ought to take care lest the court trial
should be inadequately extended and even should prevent the accused's
avoidance in the main court trial. This paper tries to determine
the basic rules for the court-sworn experts in the branch of internal
medicine and would like to facilitate them to judge under which circumstances
a seriously ill accused may appear in trial proceedings without exposing
him to a serious damage of his health or even endangerment of his
life.},

We argue that the location of synapses in the dendritic tree, and
the type of dendritic excitability associated with each synapse,
play decisive roles in determining the plastic properties of that
synapse. Furthermore, since the electrical properties of the dendritic
tree are not static, but can be altered by neuromodulators and by
synaptic activity itself, we discuss how learning rules may be dynamically
shaped by tuning dendritic function. We conclude by describing how
this reciprocal relationship between plasticity of dendritic excitability

in frequency between two consecutive mechanical vibrations applied

operations: encoding the two consecutive stimuli, maintaining the
first stimulus in working memory, comparing the second stimulus with
the memory trace left by the first stimulus and communicating the
result of the comparison to the motor apparatus. We studied this
chain of neural operations by recording and manipulating neurons
from different areas of the cerebral cortex while monkeys performed
the task. The results indicate that neurons of the primary somatosensory
cortex (S1) generate a neural representation of vibrotactile stimuli
which correlates closely with psychophysical performance. Discrimination
based on microstimulation patterns injected into clusters of S1 neurons
is indistinguishable from that produced by natural stimuli. Neurons
from the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), prefrontal cortex and
medial premotor cortex (MPC) display at different times the trace
of the first stimulus during the workingmemory component of the task.
Neurons from S2 and MPC appear to show the comparison between the
two stimuli and correlate with the behavioural decisions. These neural
operations may contribute to the sensory-discrimination process studied
here.},

abstract = {Individual pyramidal neurons of neocortex show sparse and variable responses to sensory stimuli in vivo. It has remained unclear how this variability extends to population responses on a trial-to-trial basis. Here, we characterized single-neuron and population responses to whisker stimulation in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of identified columns in rat barrel cortex using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Optical detection of single action potentials from evoked calcium transients revealed low spontaneous firing rates (0.25 Hz), variable response probabilities (range, 0-0.5; mean, 0.2 inside barrel column), and weak angular tuning of L2/3 neurons. On average, both the single-neuron response probability and the percentage of the local population activated were higher in the barrel column than above septa or in neighboring columns. Within the barrel column, mean response probability was highest in the center (0.4) and declined toward the barrel border. Neuronal pairs showed correlations in both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity that depended on the location of the neurons. Correlation decreased with increasing distance between neurons and, for neuronal pairs the same distance apart, with distance of the pair from the barrel column center. Although neurons are therefore not activated independently from each other, we did not observe precisely repeating spatial activation patterns. Instead, population responses showed large trial-to-trial variability. Nevertheless, the accuracy of decoding stimulus onset times from local population activity increased with population size and depended on anatomical location. We conclude that, despite their sparseness and variability, L2/3 population responses show a clear spatial organization on the columnar scale.},

abstract = {To understand the precise microarchitecture of the cortical circuitry, it is crucial to know the distribution of synaptic connections and their synaptic strengths at the level of a single cell, rather than a group of cells. Here, we describe a new application of two-photon photolysis of caged glutamate that enabled us to induce an action potential in only a small number (about five) of pyramidal neurons by increasing the volume of two-photon excitation by reducing the effective numerical aperture of the objective. We performed whole cell patch-clamp recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex and stimulated many neurons in a large three-dimensional space (approximately 600 x 600 x 100 microm) including neurons in layers 2/3 and 4 using this new technique. We mapped the density and amplitude of unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents and found that the basic microarchitecture of excitatory synaptic connections consists of two regions: a columnar, dense core region with a radius of 150 microm and an outer, sparse region. The dense core region includes the majority of strong synaptic connections in layer 2/3. Our results reveal the columnar organization of synaptic connectivity in the rat visual cortex, where functional columns have not been clearly demonstrated. Thus this technique will be a uniquely powerful tool for quantifying synaptic connectivity and manipulating neural activity at the single-cell level.},

Most of our knowledge about the detailed organization of hippocampal circuitry responsible for these functions is derived from anatomical studies. These studies present an incomplete picture, however, because the functional character and importance of connections are often not revealed by anatomy. Here, we used a physiological method (photostimulation with caged glutamate) to probe the fine pattern of functional connectivity between the CA3 and CA1 subfields in the mouse hippocampal slice preparation. We recorded intracellularly from CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons while scanning with photostimulation across the entire CA3 subfield with high spatial resolution. Our results show that, at a given septotemporal level, nearby CA1 neurons receive synaptic inputs from neighboring CA3 neurons. Thus, the CA3 to CA1 mapping preserves neighbor relations.},

abstract = {The formation of social attachments is a critical component of human relationships. Infants begin to bond to their caregivers from the moment of birth, and these social bonds continue to provide regulatory emotional functions throughout adulthood. It is difficult to examine the interactions between social experience and the biological origins of these complex behaviors because children undergo both brain development and accumulate social experience at the same time. We had a rare opportunity to examine children who were reared in extremely aberrant social environments where they were deprived of the kind of care-giving typical for our species. The present experiment in nature provides insight into the role of early experience on the brain systems underlying the development of emotional behavior. These data indicate that the vasopressin and oxytocin neuropeptide systems, which are critical in the establishment of social bonds and the regulation of emotional behaviors, are affected by early social experience. The results of this experiment suggest a potential mechanism whose atypical function may explain the pervasive social and emotional difficulties observed in many children who have experienced aberrant care-giving. The present findings are consistent with the view that there is a critical role for early experience in the development of the brain systems underlying basic aspects of human social behavior.},

abstract = {In awake animals, the cerebral cortex displays an "activated" state, with distinct characteristics compared to other states like slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. These characteristics include a sustained depolarized membrane potential (V(m)) and irregular firing activity. In the present paper, we evaluate our understanding of cortical activated states from a computational neuroscience point of view. We start by reviewing the electrophysiological characteristics of activated cortical states based on recordings and analysis performed in awake cat association cortex. These analyses show that cortical activity is characterized by an apparent Poisson-distributed stochastic dynamics, both at the single-cell and population levels, and that single cells display a high-conductance state dominated by inhibition. We next overview computational models of the "awake" cortex, and perform the same analyses as in the experiments. Many properties identified experimentally are indeed reproduced by models, such as depolarized V(m), irregular firing with apparent Poisson statistics, and the determinant role of inhibitory fluctuations on spiking. However, other features are not well reproduced, such as firing statistics and the conductance state of the membrane, suggesting that the network state displayed by models is not entirely correct. We also show how networks can approach a correct conductance state, suggesting ways by which future models will generate activity fully consistent with experimental data.},

The usual analysis strategy is fundamentally identical across these contexts--it amounts to calculating the average value of the high-dimensional variable for each value of the categorical variable and comparing these results by subtraction. Though intuitive and straightforward, this procedure may be inaccurate or inefficient and may overlook important details. Sophisticated approaches have been developed within these several experimental contexts, but they are rarely applied beyond the context in which they were developed.

abstract = {We discuss the strong-coupling expansion in Euclidean field theory.
In a formal representation for teh Schwinger functional, we treat
the off-diagonal terms of the Gaussian factor as a perturbation abotu
the remaining terms of the functional integral. In this way, we develop
a perturbative expansion around the ultra-local model, where fields
defined at different points of Euclidean space are decoupled. We
first study the strong-coupling expansion in the lambda phi\^{}4\_d theory
and also quantum electrodynamics. Assuming the ultra-local approximation,
we examine the singularities of these perturbative expansions, analysing
the analytic structrure of the zero-dimensional generating functions
in the complex coupling constant plane. Second, we discuss the ultra-local
generating functional in two idealized field theory models defined
by the following interaction Lagrangians: L\_II(g\_1,g\_2;phi)=g\_1 phi\^{}p(x)+g\_2
phi\^{}-p(x), and the sinh-Gordon model, i.e. L\_III(g\_3,g\_4;phi)=g\_3(cosh(g\_4
phi(x))-1). To control the divergences of the strong-coupling perturbative
expansion two different steps are used throughout the paper. First,
we introduce a lattice structure to give meaning to the ultra-local
generating functional. Using an analytic regularization procedure
we discuss briefly how it is possible to obtain a renormalized Schwinger
functional associated with these scalar models, going beyond the
ultra-local approximation without using a lattice regularization
procedure. Using the strong-coupling perturbative expansion we shod
how it is possible to compute the renormalized vacuum energy of a
self-interacting scalar field, going beyond the one-loop level.},

abstract = {Different from traditional Fourier analysis, a signal can be decomposed into amplitude and frequency modulation components. The speech processing strategy in most modern cochlear implants only extracts and encodes amplitude modulation in a limited number of frequency bands. While amplitude modulation encoding has allowed cochlear implant users to achieve good speech recognition in quiet, their performance in noise is severely compromised. Here, we propose a novel speech processing strategy that encodes both amplitude and frequency modulations in order to improve cochlear implant performance in noise. By removing the center frequency from the subband signals and additionally limiting the frequency modulation's range and rate, the present strategy transforms the fast-varying temporal fine structure into a slowly varying frequency modulation signal. As a first step, we evaluated the potential contribution of additional frequency modulation to speech recognition in noise via acoustic simulations of the cochlear implant. We found that while amplitude modulation from a limited number of spectral bands is sufficient to support speech recognition in quiet, frequency modulation is needed to support speech recognition in noise. In particular, improvement by as much as 71 percentage points was observed for sentence recognition in the presence of a competing voice. The present result strongly suggests that frequency modulation be extracted and encoded to improve cochlear implant performance in realistic listening situations. We have proposed several implementation methods to stimulate further investigation. Index Terms-Amplitude modulation, cochlear implant, fine structure, frequency modulation, signal processing, speech recognition, temporal envelope.},

Although defects in synaptic plasticity in the cerebral cortex have been linked to cognitive impairments in Fmr1 knock-out (ko) mice, the specific cortical circuits affected in the syndrome are unknown. Here, we investigated the development of excitatory projections in the barrel cortex of Fmr1 ko mice. In 2-week-old Fmr1 ko mice, a major ascending projection connecting layer 4 (L4) to L3 (L4-->L3), was defective in multiple and independent ways: its strength was reduced, caused by a lower connection probability; the axonal arbors of L4 cells were spatially diffuse in L2/3; the L4-->L3 projection did not show experience-dependent plasticity. By 3 weeks, the strength of the L4-->L3 projection was similar to that of wild type. Our data indicate that Fmr1 shapes sensory cortical circuits during a developmental critical period.},

We used two-photon, video-rate microscopy to image Ca(2+) signals evoked by photoreleased IP(3) in pyramidal neurons of mouse prefrontal cortex. Ca(2+) responses to photoreleased IP(3) varied greatly between different neurons; however, within IP(3)-responsive neurons, the soma invariably showed highest sensitivity, with signals increasing nonlinearly with [IP(3)]. Responses to paired photorelease displayed inhibition, whereas IP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) liberation was potentiated by Ca(2+) entry during action potentials and vice versa. IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signals strongly inhibited spike firing through activation of K(+) membrane conductance. Metabotropic signaling via the phosphoinositide pathway thus serves as a powerful and sustained modulator of excitability in cortical neurons and displays complex reciprocal interactions between electrical and chemical signals.},

abstract = {White matter fiber clustering aims to get insight about anatomical structures in order to generate atlases, perform clear visualizations, and compute statistics across subjects, all important and current neuroimaging problems. In this work, we present a diffusion maps clustering method applied to diffusion MRI in order to segment complex white matter fiber bundles. It is well known that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is restricted in complex fiber regions with crossings and this is why recent high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) such as Q-Ball imaging (QBI) has been introduced to overcome these limitations. QBI reconstructs the diffusion orientation distribution function (ODF), a spherical function that has its maxima agreeing with the underlying fiber populations. In this paper, we use a spherical harmonic ODF representation as input to the diffusion maps clustering method. We first show the advantage of using diffusion maps clustering over classical methods such as N-Cuts and Laplacian eigenmaps. In particular, our ODF diffusion maps requires a smaller number of hypothesis from the input data, reduces the number of artifacts in the segmentation, and automatically exhibits the number of clusters segmenting the Q-Ball image by using an adaptive scale-space parameter. We also show that our ODF diffusion maps clustering can reproduce published results using the diffusion tensor (DT) clustering with N-Cuts on simple synthetic images without crossings. On more complex data with crossings, we show that our ODF-based method succeeds to separate fiber bundles and crossing regions whereas the DT-based methods generate artifacts and exhibit wrong number of clusters. Finally, we show results on a real-brain dataset where we segment well-known fiber bundles.},

abstract = {This paper describes a general nonlinear dynamical model for neural system identification. It describes an algorithm for fitting a simple form of the model to spike train data, and reports on this algorithm's performance in identifying the structure and parameters of simulated neurons. The central element of the model is a Wiener-Bose dynamic nonlinearity that ensures that the model is able to approximate the behaviour of an arbitrary nonlinear dynamical system. Nonlinearities associated with spike generation and transmission are treated by placing the Wiener-Bose system in cascade with pulse frequency modulators and demodulators, and the static nonlinearity at the output of the Wiener-Bose system is decomposed into a rectifier and a multinomial. This simplifies the model without reducing its generality for neuronal system identification. Model elements can be characterised using standard methods of dynamical systems analysis, and the model has a simple form that can be implemented and simulated efficiently. This model bears a structural resemblance to real neurons; it may be regarded as a connectionist "neuron" that has been generalized in a realistic way to enable it to mimic the behaviour of an arbitrary nonlinear system, or conversely as a general nonlinear model that has been constrained to make it easy to fit to spike train data. Tests with simulated data show that the identification algorithm can accurately estimate the structure and parameters of neuron-like nonlinear dynamical systems using data sets containing only a few hundred spikes.},

composite systems in quantum field theory is the light-front Fock
expansion which encodes the properties of a hadrons in terms of a

in the doubly-transverse light-cone gauge has a number of remarkable
advantages, including explicit unitarity, a physical Fock expansion,
the absence of ghost degrees of freedom, and the decoupling properties
needed to prove factorization theorems in high momentum transfer
inclusive and exclusive reactions. A number of applications are discussed
in these lectures, including semileptonic B decays, two-photon exclusive
reactions, diffractive dissociation into jets, and deeply virtual
Compton scattering. The relation of the intrinsic sea to the light-front
wavefunctions is discussed. Light-front quantization can also be
used in the Hamiltonian form to construct an event generator for
high energy physics reactions at the amplitude level. The light-cone
partition function, summed over exponentiallyweighted light-cone
energies, has simple boost properties which may be useful for studies
in heavy ion collisions. I also review recent work which shows that
the structure functions measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering
are affected by final-state rescattering, thus modifying their connection
to light-front probability distributions. In particular, the shadowing
of nuclear structure functions is due to destructive interference
effects from leading-twist diffraction of the virtual photon, physics

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state temporal correlations (RSTC) are two leading techniques for investigating the connectivity of the human brain. They have been widely used to investigate the strength of anatomical and functional connections between distant brain regions in healthy subjects, and in clinical populations. Though they are both based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) they have not yet been compared directly. In this work both techniques were employed to create global connectivity matrices covering the whole brain gray matter. This allowed for direct comparisons between functional connectivity measured by RSTC with anatomical connectivity quantified using DTI tractography. We found that connectivity matrices obtained using both techniques showed significant agreement. Connectivity maps created for a priori defined anatomical regions showed significant correlation, and furthermore agreement was especially high in regions showing strong overall connectivity, such as those belonging to the default mode network. Direct comparison between functional RSTC and anatomical DTI connectivity, presented here for the first time, links two powerful approaches for investigating brain connectivity and shows their strong agreement. It provides a crucial multi-modal validation for resting state correlations as representing neuronal connectivity. The combination of both techniques presented here allows for further combining them to provide richer representation of brain connectivity both in the healthy brain and in clinical conditions.},

abstract = {The spectral selectivity of auditory nerve fibers was characterized by a method based on responses to random-spectrum-shape stimuli. The method models the average discharge rate of fibers for steady stimuli and is based on responses to approximately 100 noise-like stimuli with pseudorandom spectral levels in 1/8- or 1/16-octave frequency bins. The model assumes that rate is determined by a linear weighting of the spectrum plus a second-order weighting of all pairs of spectrum values within a certain frequency range of best frequency. The method allows prediction of rate responses to stimuli with arbitrary wideband spectral shapes, thus providing a direct test of the degree of linearity of spectral processing Auditory-nerve fibers are shown to rely mainly on linear weighting of the stimulus spectrum; however, significant second-order terms are present and are important in predicting responses to random-spectrum shape stimuli, although not for predicting responses to noise filtered with cat head-related transfer functions. The second-order terms weight the products of levels at identical frequencies positively and the products of different frequencies negatively. As such, they model both curvature in the rate versus level function and suppressive interactions between different frequency components. The first- and second-order characterizations derived in this method provide a measure of higher-order nonlinearities in neurons, albeit without providing information about temporal characteristics.},

Whereas philosophers have discussed for centuries the apparent lack of a causal component for free will, many biologists still seem to be remarkably at ease with this notion of free will; and furthermore, our judicial system is based on such a belief.

Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. We review three of them-synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic redistribution-and discuss their functional implications.},

abstract = {We propose an integral concept for tractography to describe crossing and splitting fibre bundles based on the fibre orientation distribution function (ODF) estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We show that in order to perform accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT provides new insight into the relationship between the HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical spherical deconvolution and improves the angular resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of this paper is the development of new deterministic and new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the full multidirectional information obtained through use of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is performed on human brain datasets comparing our new deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an application of our new probabilistic tracking, we quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects. Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to incorrect interpretations of brain functions.},

abstract = {A computational model was developed for the responses of low-frequency auditory-nerve (AN) fibers in cat. The goal was to produce realistic temporal response properties and average discharge rates in response to simple and complex stimuli. Temporal and average-rate properties of AN responses change as a function of sound-pressure level due to nonlinearities in the auditory periphery. The input stage of the AN model is a narrow-band filter that simulates the mechanical tuning of the basilar membrane. The parameters of this filter vary continuously as a function of stimulus level via a feedback mechanism, simulating the compressive nonlinearity associated with the mechanics of the basilar membrane. A memoryless, saturating nonlinearity and two low-pass filters simulate transduction and membrane properties of the inner hair cell (IHC). A diffusion model for the IHC-AN synapse introduces adaptation. Finally, a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, modified by absolute and relative refractoriness, provides the output discharge times. Responses to several different stimuli are presented. These responses illustrate nonlinear temporal response properties that cannot be achieved with linear models for AN fibers.},

In line with these previous works, this article provides a detailed mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates that helps to highlight the differences and similarities between various related q-space methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and diffusion orientation transform imaging (DOT). This formulation provides a direct relationship between the orientation distribution function (ODF) and the diffusion data without using any approximation. Under this relationship, the exact ODF can be computed by means of the Radon transform of the radial projection (in q-space) of the diffusion MRI signal. This new methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging (EQBI), was put into practice using an analytical ODF estimation in terms of spherical harmonics that allows obtaining model-free and model-based reconstructions. This work provides a new framework for combining information coming from diffusion data recorded on multiple spherical shells in q-space (hybrid diffusion imaging encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping ODF to a high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more efficient development of diffusion MRI experiments for obtaining better ODF estimates.},

abstract = {The functional role of an individual neuron within a cortical circuit is largely determined by that neuron's synaptic input. We examined the laminar sources of local input to subtypes of cortical neurons in layer 2/3 of rat visual cortex using laser scanning photostimulation. We identified three distinct laminar patterns of excitatory input that correspond to physiological and morphological subtypes of neurons. Fast-spiking inhibitory basket cells and excitatory pyramidal neurons received strong excitatory input from middle cortical layers. In contrast, adapting inhibitory interneurons received their strongest excitatory input either from deep layers or laterally from within layer 2/3. Thus, differential laminar sources of excitatory inputs contribute to the functional diversity of cortical inhibitory interneurons.},

abstract = {Zebrafish embryos offer a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms
by which nicotine exposure impacts early vertebrate development.
Embryos exposed to nicotine become functionally paralyzed by 42 hpf
suggesting that the neuromuscular system is compromised in exposed
embryos. We previously demonstrated that secondary spinal motoneurons
in nicotine-exposed embryos were delayed in development and that
their axons made pathfinding errors (Svoboda, K.R., Vijayaraghaven,
S., Tanguay, R.L., 2002. Nicotinic receptors mediate changes in spinal
motoneuron development and axonal pathfinding in embryonic zebrafish
exposed to nicotine. J. Neurosci. 22, 10731-10741). In that study,
we did not consider the potential role that altered skeletal muscle
development caused by nicotine exposure could play in contributing
to the errors in spinal motoneuron axon pathfinding. In this study,
we show that an alteration in skeletal muscle development occurs
in tandem with alterations in spinal motoneuron development upon
exposure to nicotine. The alteration in the muscle involves the binding
of nicotine to the muscle-specific AChRs. The nicotine-induced alteration
in muscle development does not occur in the zebrafish mutant (sofa
potato, [sop]), which lacks muscle-specific AChRs. Even though muscle
development is unaffected by nicotine exposure in sop mutants, motoneuron
axonal pathfinding errors still occur in these mutants, indicating
a direct effect of nicotine exposure on nervous system development.},

@article{Zeng2006,
abstract = {All aspects of RNA metabolism are regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that directly associate with the RNA. Some aspects of RNA biology such as RNA abundance can be readily assessed using standard hybridization technologies. However, identification of RBPs that specifically associate with selected RNAs has been more difficult, particularly when attempting to assess this in live cells. The peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-assisted identification of RBPs (PAIR) technology has recently been developed to overcome this issue. The PAIR technology uses a cell membrane-penetrating peptide (CPP) to efficiently deliver into the cell its linked PNA oligomer that complements the target mRNA sequence. The PNA will then anneal to its target mRNA in the living cell, and then covalently couple to the mRNA-RBP complexes subsequent to an ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking step. The resulting PNA-RNA-RBP complex can be isolated using sense oligonucleotide magnetic beads, and the RBPs can then be identified by mass spectrometry (MS). This procedure can usually be completed within 3 d. The use of the PAIR procedure promises to provide insight into the dynamics of RNA processing, transport, degradation and translation in live cells.},

@article{Zhou2008,
abstract = {Basal dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons are relatively short and directly attached to the cell body. This allows electrical signals arising in basal dendrites to strongly influence the neuronal output. Likewise, somatic action potentials (APs) should readily propagate back into the basilar dendritic tree to influence synaptic plasticity. Two recent studies, however, determined that sodium APs are severely attenuated in basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, so that they completely fail in distal dendritic segments. Here we used the latest improvements in the voltage-sensitive dye imaging technique (Zhou et al., 2007) to study AP backpropagation in basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the rat prefrontal cortex. With a signal-to-noise ratio of > 15 and minimal temporal averaging (only four sweeps) we were able to sample AP waveforms from the very last segments of individual dendritic branches (dendritic tips). We found that in short- (< 150 microm) and medium (150-200 microm in length)-range basal dendrites APs backpropagated with modest changes in AP half-width or AP rise-time. The lack of substantial changes in AP shape and dynamics of rise is inconsistent with the AP-failure model. The lack of substantial amplitude boosting of the third AP in the high-frequency burst also suggests that in short- and medium-range basal dendrites backpropagating APs were not severely attenuated. Our results show that the AP-failure concept does not apply in all basal dendrites of the rat prefrontal cortex. The majority of synaptic contacts in the basilar dendritic tree actually received significant AP-associated electrical and calcium transients.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging, 23 (2) 137-152) to higher dimensions. This results in a three-way decomposition that represents the different signals and artefacts present in the data in terms of their temporal, spatial, and subject-dependent variations. The technique is derived from and compared with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC; Harshman and Lundy, 1984. In Research methods for multimode data analysis, chapter 5, pages 122-215. Praeger, New York). Using simulated data as well as data from multisession and multisubject FMRI studies we demonstrate that the tensor PICA approach is able to efficiently and accurately extract signals of interest in the spatial, temporal, and subject/session domain. The final decompositions improve upon PARAFAC results in terms of greater accuracy, reduced interference between the different estimated sources (reduced cross-talk), robustness (against deviations of the data from modeling assumptions and against overfitting), and computational speed. On real FMRI 'activation' data, the tensor PICA approach is able to extract plausible activation maps, time courses, and session/subject modes as well as provide a rich description of additional processes of interest such as image artefacts or secondary activation patterns. The resulting data decomposition gives simple and useful representations of multisubject/multisession FMRI data that can aid the interpretation and optimization of group FMRI studies beyond what can be achieved using model-based analysis techniques.},

Visualization of spines using live-imaging techniques provides convincing evidence that spine morphology is altered in response to certain forms of LTP-inducing stimulation. Thus, information storage at the cellular level appears to involve changes in spine morphology that support changes in synaptic strength produced by certain patterns of synaptic activity. Because the structure of a spine is determined by its underlying actin cytoskeleton, there has been much effort to identify signaling pathways linking synaptic activity to control of actin polymerization. This review, part of the TINS Synaptic Connectivity series, discusses recent studies that implicate EphB and NMDA receptors in the regulation of actin-binding proteins through modulation of Rho family small GTPases.},

delay and loss performance information based on end-to-end (edge)

discovering network topology solely from host-based, unicast measure-

a novel delay-based measurement scheme that does not require clock
synchronization, making it more practical than other previous proposals.
Due to the nature of the measurement procedure, our methodology has
the potential to identify layer two switching elements (provided
they are logical topology branching points and induce some measur-
able switching delay). Second, we propose a maximum pe- nalized likelihood
criterion for topology identification. This is a global optimality
criterion, in contrast to other recent proposals for topology identification
that employ subopti- mal, pair-merging strategies. We develop a novel
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for rapid determi- nation
of the most likely topologies. The performance of our new probing
scheme and identification algorithm is explored through simulation

In both types of neurons, persistent sodium currents are necessary for the generation of the spontaneous activity.

abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying the sense of joint position and movement remain controversial. While cutaneous receptors are known to contribute to kinesthesia for the fingers, the present experiments test the hypothesis that they contribute at other major joints. Illusory movements were evoked at the interphalangeal (IP) joints of the index finger, the elbow, and the knee by stimulation of populations of cutaneous and muscle spindle receptors, both separately and together. Subjects matched perceived movements with voluntary movements of homologous joints on the contralateral side. Cutaneous receptors were activated by stretch of the skin (using 2 intensities of stretch) and vibration activated muscle spindle receptors. Stimuli were designed to activate receptors that discharge during joint flexion. For the index finger, vibration was applied over the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the hand, to evoke illusory metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion, and skin stretch was delivered around the IP joints. The strong skin stretch evoked the illusion of flexion of the proximal IP joint in 6/8 subjects (12 +/- 5 degrees, mean +/- SE). For the group, strong skin stretch delivered during vibration increased the perceived flexion of the proximal IP joint by eight times with a concomitant decrease in perceived flexion of the MCP joint compared with vibration alone (P < 0.05). For the elbow, vibration was applied over the distal tendon of triceps brachii and skin stretch over the dorsal forearm. When delivered alone, strong skin stretch evoked illusory elbow flexion in 5/10 subjects (9 +/- 4 degrees). Simultaneous strong skin stretch and vibration increased the illusory elbow flexion for the group by 1.5 times compared with vibration (P < 0.05). For the knee, vibration was applied over the patellar tendon and skin stretch over the thigh. Skin stretch alone evoked illusory knee flexion in 3/10 subjects (8 +/- 4 degrees) and when delivered during vibration, perceived knee flexion increased for the group by 1.4 times compared with vibration (P < 0.05). Hence inputs from cutaneous receptors, muscle receptors, and combined inputs from both receptors likely subserve kinesthesia at joints throughout the body.},

abstract = {Rapid calcium concentration changes in postsynaptic structures are crucial for synaptic plasticity. Thus far, the determinants of postsynaptic calcium dynamics have been studied predominantly based on the decay kinetics of calcium transients. Calcium rise times in spines in response to single action potentials (AP) are almost never measured due to technical limitations, but they could be crucial for synaptic plasticity. With high-speed, precisely-targeted, two-photon point imaging we measured both calcium rise and decay kinetics in spines and secondary dendrites in neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that both rise and decay kinetics of changes in calcium-indicator fluorescence are about twice as fast in spines. During AP trains, spine calcium changes follow each AP, but not in dendrites. Apart from the higher surface-to-volume ratio (SVR), we observed that neocortical dendritic spines have a markedly smaller endogenous buffer capacity with respect to their parental dendrites. Calcium influx time course and calcium extrusion rate were both in the same range for spines and dendrites when fitted with a dynamic multi-compartment model that included calcium binding kinetics and diffusion. In a subsequent analysis we used this model to investigate which parameters are critical determinants in spine calcium dynamics. The model confirmed the experimental findings: a higher SVR is not sufficient by itself to explain the faster rise time kinetics in spines, but only when paired with a lower buffer capacity in spines. Simulations at zero calcium-dye conditions show that calmodulin is more efficiently activated in spines, which indicates that spine morphology and buffering conditions in neocortical spines favor synaptic plasticity.},

While there is a relatively mature literature on post mortem diffusion imaging of animals, human brains have proven more challenging due to their incompatibility with high-performance scanners. This study presents a method for post mortem diffusion imaging of whole, human brains using a clinical 3-Tesla scanner with a 3D segmented EPI spin-echo sequence. Results in eleven brains at 0.94×0.94×0.94 mm resolution are presented, and in a single brain at 0.73×0.73×0.73 mm resolution. Region-of-interest analysis of diffusion tensor parameters indicate that these properties are altered compared to in vivo (reduced diffusivity and anisotropy), with significant dependence on post mortem interval (time from death to fixation). Despite these alterations, diffusion tractography of several major tracts is successfully demonstrated at both resolutions. We also report novel findings of cortical anisotropy and partial volume effects.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterns of dorsal root-evoked potentials were studied in transverse slices of the rat spinal cord by monitoring optical signals from a voltage-sensitive dye with multiple-photodiode optic camera. Typically, dorsal root stimulation generated two basic waveforms of voltage images: dual-component images consisting of fast, spike-like signal followed by a slow signal in the dorsal horn, and small, slow signals in the ventral horn. To qualitatively relate the optical signals to membrane potentials, whole cell recordings were combined with measurements of light absorption in the area around the soma. The slow optical signals correlated closely with subthreshold postsynaptic potentials in all regions of the cord. The spike-like component was not associated with postsynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the fast signal was generated by presynaptic action potentials. Firing in a single neuron could not be detected optically, implying that local voltage images originated from synchronously activated neuronal ensembles. Blocking glutamatergic synaptic transmission inhibited excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and significantly reduced the slow optical signals, indicating that they were mediated by glutamatergic synapses. Suppressing glycine-mediated inhibition increased the amplitude of both optical signals and EPSPs, while blocking GABA(A) receptor-mediated synapses, increased the amplitude and time course of EPSPs and prolonged the duration of voltage images in larger areas of the slice. The close correlation between evoked EPSPs and their respective local voltage images shows the advantage of the high temporal resolution optical system in measuring both the spatiotemporal dynamics of segmental network excitation and integrated potentials of neuronal ensembles at identified sites.},

abstract = {Sensory systems use adaptive coding mechanisms to filter redundant information from the environment to efficiently represent the external world. One such mechanism found in most sensory neurons is rate adaptation, defined as a reduction in firing rate in response to a constant stimulus. In auditory nerve, this form of adaptation is likely mediated by exhaustion of release-ready synaptic vesicles in the cochlear hair cell. To better understand how specific synaptic mechanisms limit neural coding strategies, we examined the trial-to-trial variability of auditory nerve responses during short-term rate-adaptation by measuring spike-timing precision and spike-count reliability. After adaptation, precision remained unchanged, whereas for all but the lowest-frequency fibers, reliability decreased. Modeling statistical properties of the hair cell-afferent fiber synapse suggested that the ability of one or a few vesicles to elicit an action potential reduces the inherent response variability expected from quantal neurotransmitter release, and thereby confers the observed count reliability at sound onset. However, with adaptation, depletion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles diminishes quantal content and antagonizes the postsynaptic enhancement of reliability. These findings imply that during the course of short-term adaptation, coding strategies that employ a rate code are constrained by increased neural noise because of vesicle depletion, whereas those that employ a temporal code are not.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed
against the HER-2 receptor. Trastuzumab-based therapy significantly
improves response rate (RR), time to progression (TTP) and overall
survival (OS) for women with HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer.
Despite its initial efficacy, acquired resistance to trastuzumab
develops in a majority of patients with MBC, and a large subset never
responds, demonstrating primary resistance. The purpose of this retrospective
study was to determine prognostic factors applicable to clinical
practice. METHODS: We enrolled 112 women with metastatic breast cancer,
who started the trastuzumab-based therapy at Masaryk Memorial Cancer
Institute until January 2007. Clinical and laboratory factors, such
as: patients conditions, character ofmetastatic spread, histology,
estrogen, progesterone and Her-2 receptor status, Her-2/neu gene
amplification, and serum tumor markers CEA, CA 15-3 and extracellular
domain of Her-2 receptor (S-HER-2 ECD) were monitored. The association
of all factors to response to therapy, time to progression (TTP)
and overall survival (OS) was assessed. RESULTS: In 95\% patients,
the trastuzumab was combined with cytostatics (83\% taxanes), 88,4\%
of patients started the trastuzumab as the first or second-line anticancer
treatment. The median TTP was 284 days (9,3 months) and the median
OS was 612 days (20,1 months) for all patients, RR was 54,5\%. The
highest RR was associated with the first-line treatment (p<0.0001)
and with HER-2 gene/Chromosome 17 ratio > 2,2 (p=0,0092). Eleven
patients (9,8\%) discontinued the treatment because of toxicity,
7 patients did it as a result of cardiotoxicity (6,2\%). CNS metastases
occurred in 31 patients (27,7\%). The S-HER-2 ECD was the most frequently
elevated serum marker at the time of the treatment initialization
(72,5\%) and at the time of the progression (55,9\%). Cox regression
analysis identified S-HER-2 ECD levels at the beginning and between
day 90 and 130 of the trastuzumab therapy as the best predictors
of TTP. On the other hand the best predictor of OS was level of CEA
before the treatment started and level of S-HER-2 ECD between day
90 and 130 of the trastuzumab therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed
that the only one predictive marker for response to trastuzumab therapy
is a proof of HER-2 tumor positivity.The highest prevalence of S-HER-2
ECD positivity among serum tumor markers and the strong association
between initial and subsequent S-HER-2 ECD serum concentrations and
time to progression and overall survival make the S-HER-2 ECD the
most significant prognostic marker.},

abstract = {Molecular profiling studies can generate abundance measurements for
thousands of transcripts, proteins, metabolites, or other species
in, for example, normal and tumor tissue samples. Treating such measurements
as features and the samples as labeled data points, sparse hyperplanes
provide a statistical methodology for classifying data points into
one of two categories (classification and prediction) and defining
a small subset of discriminatory features (relevant feature identification).
However, this and other extant classification methods address only
implicitly the issue of observed data being a combination of underlying
signals and noise. Recently, robust optimization has emerged as a
powerful framework for handling uncertain data explicitly. Here,
ideas from this field are exploited to develop robust sparse hyperplanes,
i.e., classification and relevant feature identification algorithms
that are resilient to variation in the data. Specifically, each data
point is associated with an explicit data uncertainty model in the
form of an ellipsoid parameterized by a center and covariance matrix.
The task of learning a robust sparse hyperplane from such data is
formulated as a second order cone program (SOCP). Gaussian and distribution-free
data uncertainty models are shown to yield SOCPs that are equivalent
to the SCOP based on ellipsoidal uncertainty. The real-world utility
of robust sparse hyperplanes is demonstrated via retrospective analysis
of breast cancer related transcript profiles. Data-dependent heuristics
are used to compute the parameters of each ellipsoidal data uncertainty
model. The generalization performance of a specific implementation,
designated \"{\i}¾“robust Liknon,\"{\i}¾” is better than its nominal counterpart.
Finally, the strengths and limitations of robust sparse hyperplanes
are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Axon calibers vary widely among different animals, neuron
classes, and even within the same neuron. What determines the diameter
of axon branches?

Results: We pursue the hypothesis that the axon caliber has evolved
to minimize signal propagation delays, while keeping arbor volume
to a minimum. For a general cost function, we show that the optimal
diameters of mother and daughter branches at a bifurcation satisfy
a power law. The derivation relies on the fact that the axon conduction
speed scales as a power of axon diameter. Although available data
are consistent with the law, there is a large spread in the data.
Future experimental tests will determine whether this spread is due
to biological variability or measurement error.

Conclusions: Minimization of arbor volume and signal propagation delay
may have been an important factor in the evolution of the brain.},

abstract = {Golgi cells are poised to integrate multimodal influences by participating

in circuits involving granule cells in the cochlear nuclei. To understand

their physiological role, intracellular recordings were made from

anatomically identified Golgi cells in slices of the cochlear nuclei

from mice. Cell bodies, dendrites, and terminals for all seven labeled

cells were restricted to the narrow plane of the superficial granule

cell domain over the ventral cochlear nucleus. The axonal arborization

was the most striking feature of all Golgi cells; a dense plexus

of terminals covered an area 200-400 microm in diameter in the vicinity

of the cell body and dendrites. Axonal beads often surrounded granule

cell bodies, indicating that granule cells are probable targets.

Cells had input resistances up to 130 M omega and fired regular,

overshooting action potentials. Golgi cells probably receive auditory

nerve input, because shocks to the cut end of the auditory nerve

excited Golgi cells with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).

The latency of EPSPs shortened to a minimum and the amplitude of

EPSPs grew in several steps as the strength of shocks was increased.

The minimum latency of EPSPs in Golgi cells was on average 1.3 milliseconds,

0.6 milliseconds longer than the minimum latencies of EPSPs in nearby

octopus and T stellate cells. The long latency raises the possibility

that Golgi cells receive input from slowly conducting, unmyelinated

auditory nerve fibers. Golgi cells are also excited by interneurons

with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, probably granule cells, because

repetitive shocks and single shocks in the absence of extracellular

Mg2+ evoked late EPSPs that were reversibly blocked by DL-2-amino-5-phosphono-valeric

abstract = {Multiple studies have shown that dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is
essential for bone and dentin mineralization. After post-translational
proteolytic cleavage, DMP1 exists within the extracellular matrix
of bone and dentin as an NH2-terminal fragment, a COOH-terminal fragment,
and the proteoglycan form of the NH2-terminal fragment (DMP1-PG).
To begin to assess the biological function of each fragment, we evaluated
the distribution of both fragments in the rat tooth and bone using
antibodies specific to the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions
of DMP1 and confocal microscopy. In rat first molar organs, the NH2-terminal
fragment localized to predentin, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment
was mainly restricted to mineralized dentin. In the growth plate
of bone, the NH2-terminal fragment appeared in the proliferation
and hypertrophic zones, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment occupied
the ossification zone. Forster resonance energy transfer analysis
showed colocalization of both fragments of DMP1 in odontoblasts and
predentin, as well as hypertrophic chondrocytes within the growth
plates of bone. The biochemical analysis of bovine teeth showed that
predentin is rich in DMP1-PG, whereas mineralized dentin primarily
contains the COOH-terminal fragment. We conclude that the differential
patterns of expression of NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal fragments
of DMP1 reflect their potentially distinct roles in the biomineralization
of dentin and bone matrices.},

abstract = {Recent physiological work has used quantal analysis to investigate
the properties of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation
in hippocampal area CA1. These analyses have revealed changes in
the strength of excitatory post-synaptic responses following long-term
potentiation that could be mediated by cellular mechanisms in the
presynaptic element, in the postsynaptic element, or in both elements.
In these studies, either minimal stimulation, presumably involving
a single presynaptic axon, or recordings from pairs of CA3 and CA1
cells have been used. Interpretation of these quantal analyses requires
knowledge about whether single or multiple synapses occur between
the presynaptic axon and its target CA1 pyramidal cells. Here, light
and serial electron microscopy was used to begin to examine this
question and a related question concerning the ultrastructure of
spines on multiple-synapse boutons. Light microscopic analyses of
Golgi preparations revealed that about 20\% of the axons occurring
in stratum radiatum come into close apposition with two to four different
dendrites of a target CA1 cell. An "apposition" was defined as a
point where the axons and dendrites crossed in the same focal plane
and therefore were sufficiently close to allow a dendritic spine
to reach the axon and possibly establish a synaptic contact. An additional
4\% of the axons wound back and forth across individual dendrites,
possibly forming multiple synapses closely spaced along the dendrites.
Serial electron microscopy revealed that 24\% of the individual axonal
boutons in stratum radiatum make synapses with multiple dendritic
spines arising from either the same or different dendritic segments.
Two adjacent boutons of the same axon could also be found to synapse
with different spines of the same dendrite. Together with the light
microscopic analysis, these observations suggest that multiple synapses
occur between single axons in stratum radiatum and their target CA1
cells, and that at least some of these synapses may occur at different
electronic distances. If these multiple synapses have different physiological
strengths, then they may obscure or smooth peaks in the frequency
histograms that are used for quantal analyses. A three-dimensional
analysis was done to compare the dimensions of pairs of dendritic
spines synapsing with individual axonal boutons. When the pairs of
spines associated with a single bouton arose from different dendrites,
at least some of which were likely to have come from different cells,
the differences between their volumes and the areas of the postsynaptic
densities were on average 100\% and ranged up to 650\%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

abstract = {RNA silencing is a common term for a group of mechanistically related
pathways that produce and employ short non-coding RNA molecules to
achieve sequence-specific gene regulation. The RNase III-enzyme Dicer
produces small RNAs (smRNAs) in both microRNA (miRNA) and RNA interference
(RNAi) pathways. miRNAs modulate physiological and developmental
gene expression. They are genome-encoded, endogenous negative regulators
of translation and mRNA stability originating from long primary transcripts
with local hairpin structures. RNAi is triggered by the processing
of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs),
which mediate sequence-specific cleavage of nascent mRNAs. The third
common class of repressive small RNAs, PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs),
is produced in a Dicer-independent manner. Current data suggest that
piRNAs protect the germline from mobile genome invaders such as transposons.
A small RNA involved in RNA silencing associates with proteins in
an effector ribonucleoprotein complex usually referred to as RNA-Induced
Silencing Complex (RISC). Key components of RISC complexes are proteins
of the Argonaute family, which determine RISC functions. During three
days in May 2008, around two hundred scientists working on RNA silencing
met at IMBA, Vienna for the 3(rd) Microsymposium on Small RNAs (Fig.

abstract = {Previous neurophysiological studies suggest that attention can alter the baseline or gain of neurons in extrastriate visual areas but that it cannot change tuning. This suggests that neurons in visual cortex function as labeled lines whose meaning does not depend on task demands. To test this common assumption, we used a system identification approach to measure spatial frequency and orientation tuning in area V4 during two attentionally demanding visual search tasks, one that required fixation and one that allowed free viewing during search. We found that spatial attention modulates response baseline and gain but does not alter tuning, consistent with previous reports. In contrast, feature-based attention often shifts neuronal tuning. These tuning shifts are inconsistent with the labeled-line model and tend to enhance responses to stimulus features that distinguish the search target. Our data suggest that V4 neurons behave as matched filters that are dynamically tuned to optimize visual search.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Tiled serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) is increasingly used to describe high-resolution anatomy of large biological specimens. In particular in neurobiology, TEM is indispensable for analysis of synaptic connectivity in the brain. Registration of ssTEM image mosaics has to recover the 3D continuity and geometrical properties of the specimen in presence of various distortions that are applied to the tissue during sectioning, staining and imaging. These include staining artifacts, mechanical deformation, missing sections and the fact that structures may appear dissimilar in consecutive sections. RESULTS: We developed a fully automatic, non-rigid but as-rigid-as-possible registration method for large tiled serial section microscopy stacks. We use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to identify corresponding landmarks within and across sections and globally optimize the pose of all tiles in terms of least square displacement of these landmark correspondences. We evaluate the precision of the approach using an artificially generated dataset designed to mimic the properties of TEM data. We demonstrate the performance of our method by registering an ssTEM dataset of the first instar larval brain of Drosophila melanogaster consisting of 6885 images. AVAILABILITY: This method is implemented as part of the open source software TrakEM2 (http://www.ini.uzh.ch/\~{}acardona/trakem2.html) and distributed through the Fiji project (http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de).},

Although p(r) is a fundamental parameter in defining synaptic efficacy, it is not uniform across all synapses, and the mechanisms by which a given synapse sets its basal release probability are unknown. By measuring p(r) at single presynaptic terminals in connected pairs of hippocampal neurons, we show that neighboring synapses on the same dendritic branch have very similar release probabilities, and p(r) is negatively correlated with the number of synapses on the branch. Increasing dendritic depolarization elicits a homeostatic decrease in p(r), and equalizing activity in the dendrite significantly reduces its variability. Our results indicate that local dendritic activity is the major determinant of basal release probability, and we suggest that this feedback regulation might be required to maintain synapses in their operational range.},

@article{Anwander2007,
abstract = {It is generally agreed that the cerebral cortex can be segregated into structurally and functionally distinct areas. Anatomical subdivision of Broca's area has been achieved using different microanatomical criteria, such as cytoarchitecture and distribution of neuroreceptors. However, brain function also strongly depends upon anatomical connectivity, which therefore forms a sensible criterion for the functio-anatomical segregation of cortical areas. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offers the opportunity to apply this criterion in the individual living subject. Probabilistic tractographic methods provide excellent means to extract the connectivity signatures from diffusion-weighting MR data sets. The correlations among these signatures may then be used by an automatic clustering method to identify cortical regions with mutually distinct and internally coherent connectivity. We made use of this principle to parcellate Broca's area. As it turned out, 3 subregions are discernible that were identified as putative Brodmann area (BA) 44, BA45, and the deep frontal operculum. These results are discussed in the light of previous evidence from other methods in both human and nonhuman primates. We conclude that plausible results can be achieved by the proposed technique, which cannot be obtained by any other method in vivo. For the first time, there is a possibility to investigate the anatomical subdivision of Broca's area noninvasively in the individual living human subject.},

In this study, we performed extensive analyses to test the hypothesis that individual differences in intelligence are associated with brain structural organization, and in particular that higher scores on intelligence tests are related to greater global efficiency of the brain anatomical network. We constructed binary and weighted brain anatomical networks in each of 79 healthy young adults utilizing diffusion tensor tractography and calculated topological properties of the networks using a graph theoretical method. Based on their IQ test scores, all subjects were divided into general and high intelligence groups and significantly higher global efficiencies were found in the networks of the latter group. Moreover, we showed significant correlations between IQ scores and network properties across all subjects while controlling for age and gender. Specifically, higher intelligence scores corresponded to a shorter characteristic path length and a higher global efficiency of the networks, indicating a more efficient parallel information transfer in the brain. The results were consistently observed not only in the binary but also in the weighted networks, which together provide convergent evidence for our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of brain structural organization may be an important biological basis for intelligence.},

@article{Hayward1999,
abstract = {A generally relativistic theory of thermodynamics is developed, based
on four main physical principles: heat is a local form of energy,
therefore described by a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass,
equivalent to conservation of heat, or the local rst law; entropy
is a local current; and non-destruction of entropy, or the local
second law. A uid is defined by the thermostatic energy tensor being
isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other yields by
certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the
thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the
dissipative (thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the
second law suggests certain equations for the dissipative energy
tensor, generalising the Israel-Stewart dissipative relations, which
describe heat conduction and viscosity including relativistic effects
and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic case, the perfect-liquid
model is recovered. In the linear approximation for entropy, the
Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for entropy,
the theory is similar to that of Israel \& Stewart, but involving
neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation,
nor non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics,
the thermal energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic,
though this is derived in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the
theory reduces in the non-relativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics
of irreversible processes due to Muller. The dissipative energy density
seems to be a new thermodynamical eld, but also exists in relativistic
kinetic theory of gases.},

abstract = {Many real-world networks describe systems in which interactions decay
with the distance between nodes. Examples include systems constrained
in real space such as transportation and communication networks,
as well as systems constrained in abstract spaces such as multivariate
biological or economic datasets and models of social networks. These
networks often display network motifs: subgraphs that recur in the
network much more often than in randomized networks. To understand
the origin of the network motifs in these networks, it is important
to study the subgraphs and network motifs that arise solely from
geometric constraints. To address this, we analyze geometric network
models, in which nodes are arranged on a lattice and edges are formed
with a probability that decays with the distance between nodes. We
present analytical solutions for the numbers of all 3 and 4-node
subgraphs, in both directed and non-directed geometric networks.
We also analyze geometric networks with arbitrary degree sequences,
and models with a field that biases for directed edges in one direction.
Scaling rules for scaling of subgraph numbers with system size, lattice
dimension and interaction range are given. Several invariant measures
are found, such as the ratio of feedback and feed-forward loops,
which do not depend on system size, dimension or connectivity function.
We find that network motifs in many real-world networks, including
social networks and neuronal networks, are not captured solely by
these geometric models. This is in line with recent evidence that
biological network motifs were selected as basic circuit elements
with defined information-processing functions.},

The most prominent feature of P/Q-type Ca2+ currents was activity-dependent

In addition, the maximal inhibition by the GABAB receptor agonist

baclofen was greater for EPSCs mediated by N-type channels than for

those mediated by P/Q-type channels. These results suggest that the

developmental switch of presynaptic Ca2+ channels from N- to P/Q-type

abstract = {Harmonic complex tones elicit a pitch sensation at their fundamental frequency (F0), even when their spectrum contains no energy at F0, a phenomenon known as "pitch of the missing fundamental." The strength of this pitch percept depends upon the degree to which individual harmonics are spaced sufficiently apart to be "resolved" by the mechanical frequency analysis in the cochlea. We investigated the resolvability of harmonics of missing-fundamental complex tones in the auditory nerve (AN) of anesthetized cats at low and moderate stimulus levels and compared the effectiveness of two representations of pitch over a much wider range of F0s (110-3,520 Hz) than in previous studies. We found that individual harmonics are increasingly well resolved in rate responses of AN fibers as the characteristic frequency (CF) increases.

abstract = {Cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo fluctuate spontaneously between two stable membrane potentials: a depolarized UP state and a hyperpolarized DOWN state. UP states temporally correspond with multineuronal firing sequences which may be important for information processing. To examine how thalamic inputs interact with ongoing cortical UP state activity, we used calcium imaging and targeted whole-cell recordings of activated neurons in thalamocortical slices of mouse somatosensory cortex. Whereas thalamic stimulation during DOWN states generated multineuronal, synchronized UP states, identical stimulation during UP states had no effect on the subthreshold membrane dynamics of the vast majority of cells or on ongoing multineuronal temporal patterns. Both thalamocortical and corticocortical PSPs were significantly reduced and neuronal input resistance was significantly decreased during cortical UP states -- mechanistically consistent with UP state insensitivity. Our results demonstrate that cortical dynamics during UP states are insensitive to thalamic inputs.},

abstract = {Persistent dose-related cognitive decrements have been reported in 28-day abstinent heavy marijuana (MJ) users. However, the neural substrates of these decrements in cognitive performance are not known. This study aimed to determine if 25-day abstinent MJ users show persistent dose-related alterations in performance and brain activity using PET H(2)(15)O during the Iowa Gambling Task-IGT (a decision-making task). Eleven heavy MJ users and 11 non-drug users participated. The MJ group resided in an inpatient research unit at the NIH/NIDA-IRP for 25 days prior to testing to ensure abstinence. A dose-related association was found between increased MJ use and lower IGT performance and alterations in brain activity. The MJ group showed greater activation in the left cerebellum and less activation in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than the Control group. When the MJ group was divided into Moderate (8-35 joints/week) and Heavy users (53-84 joints/week), the Heavy MJ group showed less activation in the left medial OFC and greater activation in the left cerebellum than the Moderate group. However, brain activity and task performance were similar between the Moderate MJ users and the Control group, suggesting a "threshold effect". These preliminary findings indicate that very heavy users of MJ have persistent decision-making deficits and alterations in brain activity. Specifically, the Heavy MJ users may focus on only the immediate reinforcing aspects of a situation (i.e., getting high) while ignoring the negative consequences. Thus, faulty decision-making could make an individual more prone to addictive behavior and more resistant to treatment. Finally, it is unclear if these neurologic findings will become progressively worse with continued heavy MJ use or if they will resolve with abstinence from MJ use.},

Regions active bilaterally during both visual and haptic shape perception, relative to texture perception in the respective modality, included parts of the superior parietal gyrus, the anterior intraparietal sulcus, and the lateral occipital complex. Of these bimodal regions, the lateral occipital complexes preferred visual over haptic stimuli, whereas the parietal areas preferred haptic over visual stimuli. Whereas most subjects reported little haptic imagery during visual shape perception, experiences of visual imagery during haptic shape perception were common. Across subjects, ratings of the vividness of visual imagery strongly predicted the amount of haptic shape-selective activity in the right, but not in the left, lateral occipital complex. Thus, visual imagery appears to contribute to activation of some, but not all, visual cortical areas during haptic perception.},

ultraviolet divergences associated with a large transverse dimensional

light-front QCD to both old-fashioned perturbative calculations for
short-distance physics and upcoming nonperturbative investigations

abstract = {To preserve multiple streams of independent information that converge onto a neuron, the information must be re-represented more efficiently in the neural response. Here we analyze the increase in the representational capacity of spike timing over rate codes using sound localization cues as an example. The inferior colliculus receives convergent input from multiple auditory brainstem nuclei, including sound localization information such as interaural level differences (ILDs), interaural timing differences (ITDs), and spectral cues. Virtual space techniques were used to create stimulus sets varying in two sound-localization parameters each. Information about the cues was quantified using a spike distance metric that allows one to separate contributions to the information arising from spike rate and spike timing. Spike timing enhances the representation of spectral and ILD cues at timescales averaging 12 ms. ITD information, however, is carried by a rate code. Comparing responses to frozen and random noise shows that the temporal information is mainly attributable to phase locking to temporal stimulus features, with an additional first-spike latency component. With rate-based codes, there is significant confounding of information about two cues presented simultaneously, meaning that the cues cannot be decoded independently. Spike-timing-based codes reduce this confounded information. Furthermore, the relative representation of the cues often changes as a function of the time resolution of the code, implying that information about multiple cues can be multiplexed onto individual spike trains.},

A spatial filter is designed to partition recorded activity into stimulus-related and stimulus-unrelated components, based on a criterion of stimulus-evoked reproducibility. Components that are not reproducible are projected out to obtain clean data. In experiments that measure stimulus-evoked activity, typically about 80\% of noise power is removed with minimal distortion of the evoked response. Signal-to-noise ratios of better than 0 dB (50\% reproducible power) may be obtained for the single most reproducible spatial component. The spatial filters are synthesized using a blind source separation method known as denoising source separation (DSS) that allows the measure of interest (here proportion of evoked power) to guide the source separation. That method is of greater general use, allowing data denoising beyond the classical stimulus-evoked response paradigm.},

abstract = {Statistical pattern classification methods based on data-random graphs were introduced recently. In this approach, a random directed graph is constructed from the data using the relative positions of the data points from various classes. Different random graphs result from different definitions of the proximity region associated with each data point and different graph statistics can be employed for data reduction. The approach used in this article is based on a parameterized family of proximity maps determining an associated family of data-random digraphs. The relative arc density of the digraph is used as the summary statistic, providing an alternative to the domination number employed previously. An important advantage of the relative arc density is that, properly re-scaled, it is a U-statistic, facilitating analytic study of its asymptotic distribution using standard U-statistic central limit theory. The approach is illustrated with an application to the testing of spatial patterns of segregation and association. Knowledge of the asymptotic distribution allows evaluation of the Pitman and Hodges-Lehmann asymptotic efficacy, and selection of the proximity map parameter to optimize efficacy. Notice that the approach presented here also has the advantage of validity for data in any dimension.},

abstract = {Harmonic complex tones elicit a pitch sensation at their fundamental frequency (F0), even when their spectrum contains no energy at F0, a phenomenon known as "pitch of the missing fundamental." The strength of this pitch percept depends upon the degree to which individual harmonics are spaced sufficiently apart to be "resolved" by the mechanical frequency analysis in the cochlea. We investigated the resolvability of harmonics of missing-fundamental complex tones in the auditory nerve (AN) of anesthetized cats at low and moderate stimulus levels and compared the effectiveness of two representations of pitch over a much wider range of F0s (110-3,520 Hz) than in previous studies. We found that individual harmonics are increasingly well resolved in rate responses of AN fibers as the characteristic frequency (CF) increases. We obtained rate-based estimates of pitch dependent upon harmonic resolvability by matching harmonic templates to profiles of average discharge rate against CF. These estimates were most accurate for F0s above 400-500 Hz, where harmonics were sufficiently resolved.

A general feature of most of the techniques based on photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) or stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) has been the use of thin biological samples in combination with total internal reflection, thus limiting the imaging depth to a fraction of an optical wavelength. However, to study whole cells or organelles that are typically up to 15 microm deep into the cell, the extension of these methods to a three-dimensional (3D) super resolution technique is required. Here, we report an advance in optical microscopy that enables imaging of protein distributions in cells with a lateral localization precision better than 50 nm at multiple imaging planes deep in biological samples. The approach is based on combining the lateral super resolution provided by PALM with two-photon temporal focusing that provides optical sectioning. We have generated super-resolution images over an axial range of approximately 10 microm in both mitochondrially labeled fixed cells, and in the membranes of living S2 Drosophila cells.},

abstract = {The spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) is a functional descriptor of the linear processing of time-varying acoustic spectra by the auditory system. By cross-correlating sustained neuronal activity with the dynamic spectrum of a spectrotemporally rich stimulus ensemble, one obtains an estimate of the STRF. In this article, the relationship between the spectrotemporal structure of any given stimulus and the quality of the STRF estimate is explored and exploited. Invoking the Fourier theorem, arbitrary dynamic spectra are described as sums of basic sinusoidal components--that is, moving ripples. Accurate estimation is found to be especially reliant on the prominence of components whose spectral and temporal characteristics are of relevance to the auditory locus under study and is sensitive to the phase relationships between components with identical temporal signatures. These and other observations have guided the development and use of stimuli with deterministic dynamic spectra composed of the superposition of many temporally orthogonal moving ripples having a restricted, relevant range of spectral scales and temporal rates. The method, termed sum-of-ripples, is similar in spirit to the white-noise approach but enjoys the same practical advantages--which equate to faster and more accurate estimation--attributable to the time-domain sum-of-sinusoids method previously employed in vision research. Application of the method is exemplified with both modeled data and experimental data from ferret primary auditory cortex (AI).},

We found that these responses did not covary with the monkeys' perceptual reports. In contrast, the activity of frontal lobe neurons did covary with trial-by-trial judgments. Further control and microstimulation experiments indicated that frontal lobe neurons are closely related to the monkeys' subjective experiences during sensory detection.},

abstract = {The neocortex is spontaneously active, however, the origin of this self-generated, patterned activity remains unknown. To detect potential "pacemaker cells," we use calcium imaging to directly identify neurons that discharge action potentials in the absence of synaptic transmissionin slices from juvenile mouse visual cortex. We characterize 60 of these neurons electrophysiologically and morphologically, finding that they belong to two classes of cells: one class composed of pyramidal neurons with a thin apical dendritic tree and a second class composed of ascending axon interneurons (Martinotti cells) located in layer 5. In both types of neurons, persistent sodium currents are necessary for the generation of the spontaneous activity. Our data demonstrate that subtypes of neocortical neurons have intrinsic mechanisms to generate persistent activity. Like in central pattern generators (CPGs), these neurons may act as "pacemakers" to initiate or pattern spontaneous activity in the neocortex.},

as discrete units termed barrels, which can be visualized at high
resolution in living brain slices. Both anatomical and physiological
properties of the layer 4 neuronal network can thus be investigated
in the context of the functional boundaries of this sensory map.
Large- scale confinement of neuronal arbors to single barrels was
suggested by restricted lateral diffusion of DiI across septa between
barrels. Morphological analysis of dendritic and axonal arborizations
of individual excitatory neurons showed that neuronal processes remain
within the barrel of origin through polarization toward the center
of the barrel. Functionally, the large-scale properties of the neuronal
network were investigated through mapping the spatial extent of field
EPSPs, which were found to attenuate at barrel borders. This ensemble
property of a layer 4 barrel was further investigated by analyzing
the connectivity of pairs of excitatory neurons with respect to the
locations of the somata. Approximately one-third of the excitatory
neurons within the same barrel were synaptically coupled. At the
septum between adjacent barrels the connectivity dropped rapidly,
and very few connections were found between neurons located in adjacent
barrels. Each layer 4 barrel is thus composed of an excitatory neuronal
network, which to a first order approximation, acts independently
of its neighbors.},

To better understand this diversity, we have performed a detailed anatomical and physiological characterization of 3 subtypes of visual cortex interneurons, isolated from transgenic mice which express green fluorescent protein in somatostatin, parvalbumin, and neuropeptide Y positive neurons. We find that these 3 groups of interneurons have systematic differences in dendritic and axonal morphologies and also characteristically differ in the frequencies, amplitude, and kinetics of the spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents they receive. Moreover, we detect a correlation between the kinetics of their synaptic inputs and quantitative aspects of their axonal arborizations. This suggests that different interneuron types could channel different temporal patterns of activity. Our results also confirm the importance of the axonal morphology to classify interneurons.},

@article{Callaway2003,
abstract = {The function of the cerebral cortex is dependent on the precise organization of the circuits formed by its component neurons. The connections between neurons are not random, but are specific at multiple levels of organization. For example, each cortical area connects to only a selected subset of other areas and within any given area the axonal and dendritic arbors of individual neurons arborize in precise, layer-specific patterns (for review see Felleman \& Van Essen, 1991; Callaway, 1998). In each layer there are dendrites from multiple cell types including cells with somata both within and outside that layer. Anatomical studies have shown that axons arborizing in a particular cortical layer can connect selectively onto dendrites of some cell types in the layer, while avoiding the dendrites of other cell types (e.g. Freund \& Gulyas, 1991; Hornung \& Celio, 1992; Staiger et al., 1996). These cell type specific connections are, however, difficult to elucidate with anatomical methods, so the frequency of such specificity has remained elusive. Recent experimental methods combining intracellular recording of single neurons with focal neuronal stimulation by uncaging glutamate with light ("photostimulation") have made the analysis of cell type specific cortical connections more tractable. These studies show that cell type specificity of connections is prevalent in cortex. Here I review photostimulation-based studies investigating the laminar sources of cortical input to distinct cell types in the visual and somatosensory cortices of rats and the primary visual cortex of monkeys.},

We demonstrate that these adjustments improve the accuracy of the neural population code close to the region of most commonly occurring sound levels.

more defined resolution of Galpha subunits of G(q)alpha/G(11)alpha

small signal of soluble G proteins was already detected in control,
hormone-unexposed cells. Hormone stimulation resulted in a slow but
continuous increase of both intensity and number of immunoreactive
signals/spots of these G proteins (10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min).
At longer times of agonist exposure (>2 hours), a marked increase
of G(q)alpha/G(11)alpha proteins was detected. The maximal level
of soluble G(q)alpha/G(11)alpha proteins was reached after 16 hours
of continuous agonist exposure. At this time interval, eight individual
immunoreactive signals of G(q)alpha/G(11)alpha proteins could be
resolved. The relative proportion among these spots was 15:42:10:11:7:7:2:5.
Solubilization of this class of Galpha proteins was thus observed

therefore rather indicate tight/persisting binding of G(q)alpha/G(11)alpha

For handling such a high-dimension inverse problem, we propose the use of (1) a global forward model of how these measures are functions of the "neural activity" of a large number of sources distributed on the cortical surface, formalized as a dynamical system, and (2) adaptive filters, as a natural solution to solve this inverse problem iteratively along the temporal dimension. This estimation framework relies on realistic physiological models, uses EEG and fMRI in a symmetric manner, and takes into account both their temporal and spatial information. We use the Kalman filter and smoother to perform such an estimation on realistic artificial data and demonstrate that the algorithm can handle the high dimensionality of these data and that it succeeds in solving this inverse problem, combining efficiently the information provided by the two modalities (this information being naturally predominantly temporal for EEG and spatial for fMRI). It performs particularly well in reconstructing a random temporally and spatially smooth activity spread over the cortex. The Kalman filter and smoother show some limitations, however, which call for the development of more specific adaptive filters. First, they do not cope well with the strong nonlinearity in the model that is necessary for an adequate description of the relation between cortical electric activities and the metabolic demand responsible for fMRI signals. Second, they fail to estimate a sparse activity (i.e., presenting sharp peaks at specific locations and times). Finally their computational cost remains high. We use schematic examples to explain these limitations and propose further developments of our method to overcome them.},

Arsines are preconcentrated and separated in a Chromosorb filled
U-tube. An automated cryotrapping unit, employing nitrogen gas formed
upon heating in the detection phase for the displacement of the cooling
liquid nitrogen, has been developed. The conditions for separation
of arsines in a Chromosorb filled U-tube have been optimized. A complete
separation of signals from arsine, methylarsine, dimethylarsine,
and trimethylarsine has been achieved within a 60 s reading window.
The limits of detection for methylated arsenicals tested were 4 ng
l(-1). Selective hydride generation is applied for the oxidation
state specific speciation analysis of inorganic and methylated arsenicals.
The arsines are generated either exclusively from trivalent or from
both tri- and pentavalent inorganic and methylated arsenicals depending
on the presence of L-cysteine as a prereductant and/or reaction modifier.
A TRIS buffer reaction medium is proposed to overcome narrow optimum
concentration range observed for the L-cysteine modified reaction
in HCl medium. The system provides uniform peak area sensitivity
for all As species. Consequently, the calibration with a single form
of As is possible. This method permits a high-throughput speciation
analysis of metabolites of inorganic arsenic in relatively complex
biological matrices such as cell culture systems without sample pretreatment,
thus preserving the distribution of tri- and pentavalent species.},

Here we show that passive long-term exposure to a spectrally enhanced acoustic environment (EAE) causes reorganization of the tonotopic map in juvenile cat auditory cortex without inducing any hearing loss. The EAE consisted of tone pips of 32 different frequencies (5-20 kHz), presented in random order at an average rate of 96 Hz. The EAE caused a strong reduction of the representation of EAE frequencies and an over-representation of frequencies neighboring those of the EAE. This is in sharp contrast with earlier developmental studies showing an enlargement of the cortical representation of EAEs consisting of a narrow frequency band. We observed fewer than normal appropriately tuned short-latency responses to EAE frequencies, together with more common long-latency responses tuned to EAE-neighboring frequencies.},

abstract = {Although the nonlinear optical effect known as second-harmonic generation (SHG) has been recognized since the earliest days of laser physics and was demonstrated through a microscope over 25 years ago, only in the past few years has it begun to emerge as a viable microscope imaging contrast mechanism for visualization of cell and tissue structure and function. Only small modifications are required to equip a standard laser-scanning two-photon microscope for second-harmonic imaging microscopy (SHIM). Recent studies of the three-dimensional in vivo structures of well-ordered protein assemblies, such as collagen, microtubules and muscle myosin, are beginning to establish SHIM as a nondestructive imaging modality that holds promise for both basic research and clinical pathology. Thus far the best signals have been obtained in a transmitted light geometry that precludes in vivo measurements on large living animals. This drawback may be addressed through improvements in the collection of SHG signals via an epi-illumination microscope configuration. In addition, SHG signals from certain membrane-bound dyes have been shown to be highly sensitive to membrane potential. Although this indicates that SHIM may become a valuable tool for probing cell physiology, the small signal size would limit the number of photons that could be collected during the course of a fast action potential. Better dyes and optimized microscope optics could ultimately lead to the imaging of neuronal electrical activity with SHIM.},

abstract = {The primate cerebral cortex is a sheet composed of many distinct areas. Each of these areas receives a large number of afferent inputs from other cortical areas (and elsewhere) and in return issues a large number of output projections. The cortex is thus innervated by a very large number of cortico-cortical connections, so that the areas and their interconnections form a network of startling complexity. The complexity of this network presents a formidable topological problem that hinders understanding of its organization. Recently, however, an optimization analysis has been applied to the connections between visual cortical areas. This optimization analysis derived a structure for the cortical visual system, a system whose organization has been extensively explored, that is consistent with known organizational features. This paper concerns an application of the same approach to the cortico-cortical connections of other major sensory systems in the primate brain, and to the connections of the entire cerebral cortex, whose organizations have not been extensively explored. The latter analysis suggests the gross topological organization of the cortical information processing system of this animal, and shows the 'place' of individual areas within this organization. The results may be suggestive for further theory and experiment.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data Driven M
arkov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian
statistical framework. The paper contrubutes to image segmentation
in three aspects. Firstly, it designs effective and well balanced
Markov Chain dynamics to explore the solution space and makes the
split and merge process reversible at a middle level vision formulation.
Thus it achieves globally optimal solution independent of initial
segmentations. Secondly, instead of computing a single maximum a
posteriori solution, it proposes a mathematical principle for computing
multiple distinct solutions to incorporate intrinsic ambiguities
in image segmentation. A k-adventurers algorithm is proposed for
extracting distinct multiple solutions from the Markov chain sequence.
Thirdly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as
clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities,
which effectively drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous
speedup in comparison to traditional jump-diffusion method [4]. Thus
DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework where the role of existing
segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region
growing, split-,erge, SNAKEs, region competition, are revealed as
either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal
probabilities. We report some results on color and grey level image

abstract = {The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics constructs the
propagator by evaluating the action, S, for all classical paths in
coordinate space. A corresponding momentum path integral may also
be defined through Fourier transforms in the endpoints. These momentum
path integrals are especially simple for several special cases, yet
no one has, to my knowledge, ever formally constructed them from
first principles, i.e., by considering all classical paths in momentum
space. I show that this is possible because there exists another
classical mechanics based on an alternate classical action, R. Hamilton\"{\i}¾’s
Canonical equations result from a variational principle in both S
and R. S uses fixed beginning and ending spatial points while R uses
fixed beginning and ending momentum points. This alternative action\"{\i}¾’s
classical mechanics also includes a Hamilton- Jacobi equation. I
also present some important subtle points concerning the beginning
and ending conditions on the action necessary to apply a Canonical
transformation. These properties explain the failure of the Canonical
transformation in the phase space path integral. It follows that
a path integral may be formulated from first principles using S in
the coordinate representation, or R, in the momentum representation.
Several example calculations are presented that illustrate this broader
view of the path integral. In particular, the normalized amplitude
for a free particle is found without using the Schr\~{A}¶dinger equation,
the internal spin degree of freedom is simply and naturally derived,
and the simple harmonic oscillator is calculated.},

abstract = {The input-output transform performed by mitral cells, the principal projection neurons of the olfactory bulb, is one of the key factors in understanding olfaction. We used combined calcium and voltage imaging from the same neuron and computer modeling to investigate signal processing in the mitral cells, focusing on the glomerular dendritic tuft. The main finding was that the dendritic tuft functions as a single electrical compartment for subthreshold signals within the range of amplitudes detectable by voltage-sensitive dye recording. These evoked EPSPs had uniform characteristics throughout the glomerular tuft. The Ca(2+) transients associated with spatially uniform subthreshold synaptic potentials were comparable but not equal in amplitude in all regions. The average range of normalized amplitudes of the EPSP-driven Ca(2+) signals from different locations on dendritic branches in the glomerular tuft was relatively narrow and appeared to be independent of the dendritic surface-to-volume ratio. The computer simulations constrained by the imaging data indicated that a synchronized activation of approximately 100 synapses randomly distributed on tuft branches was sufficient to generate spatially homogenous EPSPs. This number of activated synapses is consistent with the data from anatomical studies. Furthermore, voltage attenuation of the EPSP along the primary dendrite at physiological temperature was weak compared with other cell types. In the model, weak attenuation of the EPSP along the primary dendrite could be accounted for by passive electrical properties of the mitral cell.},

abstract = {Plasticity in connections between neurons allows learning and adaptation,
but it also allows noise to degrade the function of a network. Ongoing
network self-repair is thus necessary. We describe a method to derive
spike-timing-dependent plasticity rules for self-repair, based on
the firing patterns of a functioning network. These plasticity rules
for self-repair also provide the basis for unsupervised learning
of new tasks. The particular plasticity rule derived for a network
depends on the network and task. Here, self-repair is illustrated
for a model of the mammalian olfactory system in which the computational
task is that of odor recognition. In this olfactory example, the
derived rule has qualitative similarity with experimental results
seen in spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Unsupervised learning
of new tasks by using the derived self-repair rule is demonstrated
by learning to recognize new odors.},
annote = {The paper deals with the question how a network subjected to plasticity
may maintain stability in performing its task [here odor recognition
in olfaction] in the presence of changes noise due to plasticity.
The question is addressed on the example of artificial neural network
for olfaction odor recognition. The plasticity rule is as follows:
a value function is assigned for each presynaptic neuron depending
on the time difference between pre \& postsynaptic cells firings.
This is a bell shaped function promoting value of neurons firing
in synchrony with two negative wings suppressing neurons that also
fire out of synchrony [all the time]. After each postsynaptic cell
firing, all presynaptic connections are removed and a fixed number
[200] of new connections with the highest values are made. System
shows stability of recognition despite drastic update rule and ability
to learn by initially broadly tuned cell the odor at which original
synaptic update was initiated. Conjecture is made that general learning
rule which favor better synchrony will result in rearrangement of
connections toward "sooner" spiking. This is said to be related to
the "center of mass" of the "value" curve associated with learning.
Small tail of positive values for "negative" relative timings is
needed to prevent such drift due to zeroing the center of mass. This
is said to reflect the fact that due to jitter in timing relevant
cells some times may fire before postsynaptic cell and by this should
be given credit in learning rule. General bottomline is as follows:
"conservatism" allows system to maintain its function even in the
presence of substantial plasticity: as long as majority follows the
same route, changes in the system will not disrupt its function;
conservatism here is implemented via synchrony criteria - when many
cells spike together, noise in their spiking may be overwhelmed by
presence of the cells number. I don't really buy right away the arguments
about drift and center of mass of learning curve.},

abstract = {Modern MRI image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric, functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific imaging targets. Algorithm investigators have several excellent public data resources to use to test, develop, and optimize their methods. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining MRI protocols in multi-parametric studies. Notably, these have included innovative approaches for fusing connectivity inferences with functional and/or anatomical characterizations. Yet, validation of the reproducibility of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered by the limited availability of appropriate multi-parametric data. We present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art assessment of brain function, structure, micro-architecture, and quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60 minute protocol on a 3T MRI scanner. We present scan-rescan reproducibility of these imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 M/10 F, 22-61 y/o). The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, thalamus, putamen, caudate, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, and brainstem were identified with mean volume-wise reproducibility of 3.5\%. We tabulate the mean intensity, variability and reproducibility of each contrast in a region of interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning and retrospective power analysis considerations. Anatomy was highly consistent on structural acquisition (\~{}1-5\% variability), while variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher (\~{}<10\%). Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures (ASL exhibited variation of 28\% in the cerebral white matter) or in thin structures (quantitative T2 varied by up to 73\% in the caudate) due, in large part, to variability in automated ROI placement. The richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis approach as opposed to a summary table. As such, all imaging data and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely available. This effort provides the neuroimaging community with a resource for optimization of algorithms that exploit the diversity of modern MRI modalities. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing development and optimization of multi-parametric imaging protocols.},

abstract = {As a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, graph matching has applications in a variety of fields, from computer vision to computational biology. In graph matching, patterns are modeled as graphs and pattern recognition amounts to finding a correspondence between the nodes of different graphs. Many formulations of this problem can be cast in general as a quadratic assignment problem, where a linear term in the objective function encodes node compatibility and a quadratic term encodes edge compatibility. The main research focus in this theme is about designing efficient algorithms for approximately solving the quadratic assignment problem, since it is NP-hard. In this paper we turn our attention to a different question: how to estimate compatibility functions such that the solution of the resulting graph matching problem best matches the expected solution that a human would manually provide. We present a method for learning graph matching: the training examples are pairs of graphs and the 'labels' are matches between them. Our experimental results reveal that learning can substantially improve the performance of standard graph matching algorithms. In particular, we find that simple linear assignment with such a learning scheme outperforms Graduated Assignment with bistochastic normalisation, a state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation algorithm.},

This method allows the manipulation of gene expression in the rodent brain with excellent spatiotemporal control; essentially any brain region of choice can be targeted and cells (or a subpopulation of cells) in that region can be stably genetically altered at any postnatal developmental stage up to adulthood. Many aspects of the method, its versatility, ease of application and high reproducibility, make it an attractive approach for studying genetic, cellular and circuit functions in the brain.

abstract = {We discuss several tests for determining whether a given set of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws does not come from a specified probability density function. The most commonly used are Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, particularly Kuiper's variant, which focus on discrepancies between the cumulative distribution function for the specified probability density and the empirical cumulative distribution function for the given set of i.i.d. draws. Unfortunately, variations in the probability density function often get smoothed over in the cumulative distribution function, making it difficult to detect discrepancies in regions where the probability density is small in comparison with its values in surrounding regions. We discuss tests without this deficiency, complementing the classical methods. The tests of the present paper are based on the plain fact that it is unlikely to draw a random number whose probability is small, provided that the draw is taken from the same distribution used in calculating the probability (thus, if we draw a random number whose probability is small, then we can be confident that we did not draw the number from the same distribution used in calculating the probability).},

One pairing of odor and electric shock stimuli or multiple, massed pairings did not alter odor-evoked calcium influx. In contrast, animals that received multiple, spaced pairings exhibited a robust increase in calcium influx into the MB axons when tested at 9 or 24 hr after training, but not at 3 hr. This modification occurred only in the alpha branch of the neurons and was blocked by mutation of the amnesiac gene, inhibition of protein synthesis, or the expression of a protein blocker of the transcription factor Creb. Thus, behavioral long-term olfactory memory appears to be encoded as a branch-specific modification of calcium influx into the alpha/beta MB neurons that occurs after spaced training in a protein synthesis-, Creb-, and amnesiac-dependent way.},

Our approach is based on polythetic decision trees, which combine powerful discriminative ability with interpretability of results. We also propose to use ensemble of classifiers within specific frequency subbands, and show that they bring systematic improvement in classification accuracy. Exploiting multi-band classification of connectivity graphs is also proposed, and we explain theoretical reasons why the technique could bring further improvement in classification performance. The choice of decision trees as classifier is shown to provide a practical way to identify a subset of connections that distinguishes best between the conditions, permitting the extraction of very compact representations for differences between brain states, which we call discriminative graphs. Our experimental results based on strict train/test separation at all stages of processing show that the method is applicable to inter-subject brain decoding with relatively low error rates for the task considered.},

abstract = {The avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) family of retroviruses
contains five highly related envelope subgroups (A to E) thought
to have evolved from a common viral ancestor in the chicken population.
Three genetic loci in chickens determine the susceptibility or resistance
of cells to infection by the subgroup A to E ASLVs. Some inbred lines
of chickens display phenotypes that are somewhere in between either
efficiently susceptible or resistant to infection by specific subgroups
of ASLV. The tvb gene encodes the receptor for subgroups B, D, and
E ASLVs. The wild-type Tvb(S1) receptor confers susceptibility to
subgroups B, D, and E ASLVs. In this study, the genetic defect that
accounts for the altered susceptibility of an inbred chicken line,
line M, to infection by ASLV(B), ASLV(D), and ASLV(E) was identified.
The tvb gene in line M, tvb(r2), encodes a mutant Tvb(S1) receptor
protein with a substitution of a serine for a cysteine at position
125 (C125S). Here, we show that the C125S substitution in Tvb(S1)
significantly reduces the susceptibility of line M cells to infection
by ASLV(B) and ASLV(D) and virtually eliminates susceptibility to
ASLV(E) infection both in cultured cells and in the incidence and
growth of avian sarcoma virus-induced sarcomas in chickens. The C125S
substitution significantly reduces the binding affinity of the Tvb(S1)
receptor for the subgroup B, D, and E ASLV envelope glycoproteins.
These are the first results that demonstrate a possible role of the
cysteine-rich domain 3 in the function of the Tvb receptors.},

abstract = {To investigate the existence and the characteristics of possible cortical operating points of the primary visual cortex, as manifested by the coherent spontaneous ongoing activity revealed by real-time optical imaging based on voltage-sensitive dyes, we studied numerically a very large-scale ( approximately 5 x 10(5)) conductance-based, integrate-and-fire neuronal network model of an approximately 16-mm(2) patch of 64 orientation hypercolumns, which incorporates both isotropic local couplings and lateral orientation-specific long-range connections with a slow NMDA component. A dynamic scenario of an intermittent desuppressed state (IDS) is identified in the computational model, which is a dynamic state of (i) high conductance, (ii) strong inhibition, and (iii) large fluctuations that arise from intermittent spiking events that are strongly correlated in time as well as in orientation domains, with the correlation time of the fluctuations controlled by the NMDA decay time scale. Our simulation results demonstrate that the IDS state captures numerically many aspects of experimental observation related to spontaneous ongoing activity, and the specific network mechanism of the IDS may suggest cortical mechanisms and the cortical operating point underlying observed spontaneous activity.},

abstract = {This study reports simulations of recent physiological results from the gerbil medial superior olive (MSO) that reveal that blocking glycinergic inhibition can shift the tuning for the interaural time difference (ITD) of the cell (Brand et al., 2002). Our simulations indicate that the model proposed in the study by Brand et al. (2002) requires precisely timed, short-duration inhibition with temporal accuracy exceeding that described in the auditory system. An alternative model is proposed that incorporates two anatomic observations in the MSO: (1) the axon arises from the dendrite that receives ipsilateral inputs; and (2) inhibitory synapses are located primarily on the soma in adult animals. When the inhibitory currents are activated or blocked, the model cell successfully simulates experimentally observed shifts in the best ITD. The asymmetrical cell structure allows an imbalance between the ipsilateral and contralateral excitatory inputs and shifts the ITD curve such that the best ITD is not at zero. Fine adjustment of the best ITD is achieved by the interplay of somatic sodium currents and synaptic inhibitory currents. The shift of the best ITD in the model is limited to approximately 0.2 ms, which is behaviorally significant with respect to ITDs encountered in perceptual tasks. The model suggests a mechanism for dynamically "fine-tuning" the ITD sensitivity of MSO cells by the opponency between depolarizing sodium currents and hyperpolarizing inhibitory currents.},

abstract = {Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling
is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses,
but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order
interactions among large groups of elements have an important role.
Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between
pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the
responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour
is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise
correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum
entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger
networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests
that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties,
and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first
test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results
are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal behavior is governed by the activity of interconnected brain circuits. Comprehensive brain wiring maps are thus needed in order to formulate hypotheses about information flow and also to guide genetic manipulations aimed at understanding how genes and circuits orchestrate complex behaviors. RESULTS: To assemble this map, we deconstructed the adult Drosophila brain into approximately 16,000 single neurons and reconstructed them into a common standardized framework to produce a virtual fly brain. We have constructed a mesoscopic map and found that it consists of 41 local processing units (LPUs), six hubs, and 58 tracts covering the whole Drosophila brain. Despite individual local variation, the architecture of the Drosophila brain shows invariance for both the aggregation of local neurons (LNs) within specific LPUs and for the connectivity of projection neurons (PNs) between the same set of LPUs. An open-access image database, named FlyCircuit, has been constructed for online data archiving, mining, analysis, and three-dimensional visualization of all single neurons, brain-wide LPUs, their wiring diagrams, and neural tracts. CONCLUSION: We found that the Drosophila brain is assembled from families of multiple LPUs and their interconnections. This provides an essential first step in the analysis of information processing within and between neurons in a complete brain.},

abstract = {Both synaptic strength and spine size vary from spine to spine, but are strongly correlated. This gradation is regulated by activity and may underlie information storage. Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is critically involved in the regulation of synaptic strength and spine size. The high amount of the kinase in the postsynaptic density has suggested that the kinase has a structural role at synapses. We demonstrated previously that the bound amount of CaMKIIalpha in spines persistently increases after induction of long-term potentiation, prompting the hypothesis that this amount may correlate with synaptic strength. To test this hypothesis we combined two recently developed methods, two-photon uncaging of glutamate for determining the EPSC of individual spines (uEPSC) and quantitative microscopy for measuring bound CaMKIIalpha in the same spines. We found that under basal conditions the relative bound amount of CaMKIIalpha varied over a 10-fold range and positively correlated with the uEPSC. Both the bound amount of CaMKIIalpha in spines and uEPSC also positively correlated with spine size. Interestingly, the bound CaMKIIalpha fraction (bound/total CaMKIIalpha in spines) remained remarkably constant across all spines. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that bound CaMKII serves as a structural organizer of postsynaptic molecules and thereby may be involved in maintaining spine size and synaptic strength.},

This analysis gives the theoretical absolute bandwidth of the restored image; however, this absolute value may not be realistic in many cases.

abstract = {Behaviours that appear to depend on processing temporal information are frequently disrupted after cerebellar damage. The present study examined the role of the cerebellum in explicit timing and its relationship to other psychological processes. We hypothesized that if the cerebellum regulates timekeeping operations then cerebellar damage should disrupt the perception and the reproduction of intervals, since both are thought to be supported by a common timekeeper mechanism. Twenty-one patients with cerebellar damage from stroke and 30 normal controls performed time perception and time reproduction tasks. In the time reproduction task, timing variability was decomposed into a central timing component (clock variability) and a motor component (motor implementation variability). We found impairments only in time reproduction (increased clock variability) in patients with medial and lateral damage involving the middle- to superior-cerebellar lobules. To explore potential reasons for the temporal processing deficits, time reproduction and perception performance were correlated with independent measures of attention, working memory, sensory discrimination and processing speed. Poorer working memory correlated with increased variability in the 'clock' component of time reproduction. In contrast, processing speed correlated best with time perception. The results did not support a role for the cerebellum in timekeeping operations. Rather, deficits in timing movements may be related to a disruption in acquiring sensory and cognitive information relevant to the task, coupled with an additional impairment in the motor-output system.},

abstract = {Bacteria have developed intricate communication capabilities (e.g. quorum-sensing, chemotactic signaling and plasmid exchange) to cooperatively self-organize into highly structured colonies with elevated environmental adaptability. We propose that bacteria use their intracellular flexibility, involving signal transduction networks and genomic plasticity, to collectively maintain linguistic communication: self and shared interpretations of chemical cues, exchange of chemical messages (semantic) and dialogues (pragmatic). Meaning-based communication permits colonial identity, intentional behavior (e.g. pheromone-based courtship for mating), purposeful alteration of colony structure (e.g. formation of fruiting bodies), decision-making (e.g. to sporulate) and the recognition and identification of other colonies - features we might begin to associate with a bacterial social intelligence. Such a social intelligence, should it exist, would require going beyond communication to encompass unknown additional intracellular processes to generate inheritable colonial memory and commonly shared genomic context.},

abstract = {We studied the contribution of a change in presynaptic calcium influx

to posttetanic potentiation (PTP) in the calyx of Held synapse, an

axosomatic synapse in the auditory brain stem. We made whole cell

patch-clamp recordings of a principal cell after loading of the presynaptic

terminal with a calcium dye. After induction of PTP by a high-frequency

train of afferent stimuli, the Fluo-4 fluorescence transients evoked

by an action potential became on average 15 +/- 4\% larger (n = 7).

Model predictions did not match the fluorescence transients evoked

by trains of brief calcium currents unless the endogenous calcium

buffer had low affinity for calcium, making a contribution of saturation

of the endogenous buffer to the synaptic potentiation we observed

in the present experiments less likely. Our data therefore suggest

that the increase of release probability during PTP at the calyx

of Held synapse is largely explained by an increase in the calcium

influx per action potential.},

abstract = {Despite growing interest in applying machine learning to neuroimaging analyses, few studies have gone beyond classifying sensory input to directly predicting behavioral output. With spatial resolution on the order of millimeters and temporal resolution on the order of seconds, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising technology for such applications. However, fMRI data's low signal-to-noise ratio, high dimensionality, and extensive spatiotemporal correlations present formidable analytic challenges. Here, we apply different machine-learning algorithms to previously acquired data to examine the ability of fMRI activation in three regions-the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and insula-to predict purchasing. Our goal was to improve spatiotemporal interpretability as well as classification accuracy. To this end, sparse penalized discriminant analysis (SPDA) enabled automatic selection of correlated variables, yielding interpretable models that generalized well to new data. Relative to logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and linear support vector machines, SPDA not only increased interpretability but also improved classification accuracy. SPDA promises to allow more precise inferences about when specific brain regions contribute to purchasing decisions. More broadly, this approach provides a general framework for using neuroimaging data to build interpretable models, including those that predict choice.},

Receptive fields are thought to provide a representation of sensory experience from which the cerebral cortex may make interpretations. While it is essential to determine a neuron's receptive field, it remains unclear which features of the acoustic environment are specifically represented by neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI). We characterized cat AI spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) by finding both the spike-triggered average (STA) and stimulus dimensions that maximized the mutual information between response and stimulus. We derived a nonlinearity relating spiking to stimulus projection onto two maximally informative dimensions (MIDs). The STA was highly correlated with the first MID. Generally, the nonlinearity for the first MID was asymmetric and often monotonic in shape, while the second MID nonlinearity was symmetric and nonmonotonic. The joint nonlinearity for both MIDs revealed that most first and second MIDs were synergistic and thus should be considered conjointly. The difference between the nonlinearities suggests different possible roles for the MIDs in auditory processing.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed a general description of parameter combinations for which specified characteristics of neuronal or network activity are constant. Our approach is based on the implicit function theorem and is applicable to activity characteristics that smoothly depend on parameters. Such smoothness is often intrinsic to neuronal systems when they are in stable functional states. The conclusions about how parameters compensate each other, developed in this study, can thus be used even without regard to the specific mathematical model describing a particular neuron or neuronal network. We showed that near a generic point in the parameter space there are infinitely many other points, or parameter combinations, for which specified characteristics of activity are the same as in the original point. These parameter combinations form a smooth manifold. This manifold can be extended as long as the gradients of characteristics are defined and independent. All possible variations of parameters compensating each other are simply all possible charts of the same manifold. The number of compensating parameters (but not parameters themselves) is fixed and equal to the number of the independent characteristics maintained. The algorithm that we developed shows how to find compensatory functional dependencies between parameters numerically. Our method can be used in the analysis of the homeostatic regulation, neuronal database search, model tuning and other applications.},

These SPARK (synthetic photoisomerizable azobenzene-regulated K(+)) channels consist of a synthetic azobenzene-containing photoswitch and a genetically modified Shaker K(+) channel protein. SPARK channels with a wild-type selectivity filter elicit hyperpolarization and suppress action potential firing when activated by 390 nm light. A mutation in the pore converts the K(+)-selective Shaker channel into a nonselective cation channel. Activation of this modified channel with the same wavelength of light elicits depolarization of the membrane potential. Expression of these depolarizing SPARK channels in neurons allows light to rapidly and reversibly trigger action potential firing. Hence, hyper- and depolarizing SPARK channels provide a means for eliciting opposite effects on neurons in response to the same light stimulus.},

abstract = {Measuring agreement between a statistical model and a spike train data series, that is, evaluating goodness of fit, is crucial for establishing the model's validity prior to using it to make inferences about a particular neural system. Assessing goodness-of-fit is a challenging problem for point process neural spike train models, especially for histogram-based models such as perstimulus time histograms (PSTH) and rate functions estimated by spike train smoothing. The time-rescaling theorem is a well-known result in probability theory, which states that any point process with an integrable conditional intensity function may be transformed into a Poisson process with unit rate. We describe how the theorem may be used to develop goodness-of-fit tests for both parametric and histogram-based point process models of neural spike trains. We apply these tests in two examples: a comparison of PSTH, inhomogeneous Poisson, and inhomogeneous Markov interval models of neural spike trains from the supplementary eye field of a macque monkey and a comparison of temporal and spatial smoothers, inhomogeneous Poisson, inhomogeneous gamma, and inhomogeneous inverse gaussian models of rat hippocampal place cell spiking activity. To help make the logic behind the time-rescaling theorem more accessible to researchers in neuroscience, we present a proof using only elementary probability theory arguments. We also show how the theorem may be used to simulate a general point process model of a spike train. Our paradigm makes it possible to compare parametric and histogram-based neural spike train models directly. These results suggest that the time-rescaling theorem can be a valuable tool for neural spike train data analysis.},

abstract = {There has recently been a great deal of interest in inferring network connectivity from the spike trains in populations of neurons. One class of useful models that can be fit easily to spiking data is based on generalized linear point process models from statistics. Once the parameters for these models are fit, the analyst is left with a nonlinear spiking network model with delays, which in general may be very difficult to understand analytically. Here we develop mean-field methods for approximating the stimulus-driven firing rates (in both the time-varying and steady-state cases), auto- and cross-correlations, and stimulus-dependent filtering properties of these networks. These approximations are valid when the contributions of individual network coupling terms are small and, hence, the total input to a neuron is approximately gaussian. These approximations lead to deterministic ordinary differential equations that are much easier to solve and analyze than direct Monte Carlo simulation of the network activity. These approximations also provide an analytical way to evaluate the linear input-output filter of neurons and how the filters are modulated by network interactions and some stimulus feature. Finally, in the case of strong refractory effects, the mean-field approximations in the generalized linear model become inaccurate; therefore, we introduce a model that captures strong refractoriness, retains all of the easy fitting properties of the standard generalized linear model, and leads to much more accurate approximations of mean firing rates and cross-correlations that retain fine temporal behaviors.},

We utilize a hierarchical form of the Laplace prior to model the sparsity of the unknown signal. We describe the relationship among a number of sparsity priors proposed in the literature, and show the advantages of the proposed model including its high degree of sparsity. Moreover, we show that some of the existing models are special cases of the proposed model. Using our model, we develop a constructive (greedy) algorithm designed for fast reconstruction useful in practical settings. Unlike most existing CS reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm is fully automated, i.e., the unknown signal coefficients and all necessary parameters are estimated solely from the observation, and, therefore, no user-intervention is needed. Additionally, the proposed algorithm provides estimates of the uncertainty of the reconstructions. We provide experimental results with synthetic 1-D signals and images, and compare with the state-of-the-art CS reconstruction algorithms demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

In this article, we describe fast methods for computing the exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) path of the hidden state variable in these models, given spike train observations. If the state transition density is log-concave and the observation model satisfies certain standard assumptions, then the optimization problem is strictly concave and can be solved rapidly with Newton-Raphson methods, because the Hessian of the loglikelihood is block tridiagonal. We can further exploit this block-tridiagonal structure to develop efficient parameter estimation methods for these models. We describe applications of this approach to neural decoding problems, with a focus on the classic integrate-and-fire model as a key example.},

Twist has an important role in EMT for tumor metastasis. The purpose
of this study was to analyze Twist function during palatal fusion.
Twist protein was expressed in palatal shelves and MEE both in vivo
and in vitro just prior to fusion. Twist mRNA increased in chicken
palates 3 and 6 hr after TGFbeta3 treatment. Palatal fusion was decreased
when cultured palatal shelves were treated with 200 nM Twist siRNA
and the subcellular localization of beta-catenin was altered. Twist
mRNA decreased in palatal shelves treated with TGFbeta3 neutralizing
antibody or LY294002, a specific phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)
inhibitor. In summary, Twist is downstream of TGFbeta3 and PI-3K
pathways during palatal fusion. However, decreasing Twist with siRNA
did not completely block palate fusion, indicating that the function
of Twist may be duplicated by other transcription factors.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

abstract = {Whole-brain neuroimaging studies have demonstrated regional variations in function within human cingulate cortex. At the same time, regional variations in cingulate anatomical connections have been found in animal models. It has, however, been difficult to estimate the relationship between connectivity and function throughout the whole cingulate cortex within the human brain. In this study, magnetic resonance diffusion tractography was used to investigate cingulate probabilistic connectivity in the human brain with two approaches. First, an algorithm was used to search for regional variations in the probabilistic connectivity profiles of all cingulate cortex voxels with the whole of the rest of the brain. Nine subregions with distinctive connectivity profiles were identified. It was possible to characterize several distinct areas in the dorsal cingulate sulcal region. Several distinct regions were also found in subgenual and perigenual cortex. Second, the probabilities of connection between cingulate cortex and 11 predefined target regions of interest were calculated. Cingulate voxels with a high probability of connection with the different targets formed separate clusters within cingulate cortex. Distinct connectivity fingerprints characterized the likelihood of connections between the extracingulate target regions and the nine cingulate subregions. Last, a meta-analysis of 171 functional studies reporting cingulate activation was performed. Seven different cognitive conditions were selected and peak activation coordinates were plotted to create maps of functional localization within the cingulate cortex. Regional functional specialization was found to be related to regional differences in probabilistic anatomical connectivity.},

@article{WickesbergOertel90,
abstract = {To understand how auditory information is processed in the cochlear

nuclei, it is crucial to know what circuitry exists and how it functions.

Previous anatomical experiments have shown that neurons in the deep

layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) project topographically

to the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) (Wickesberg and Oertel,

1988). Because interneurons in the DCN and their targets in AVCN

are excited by the same group of auditory nerve fibers, the projection

is frequency-specific. Here we report that microinjections of glutamate

in the DCN evoke trains of IPSPs in individual, impaled AVCN neurons

in brain slices of the cochlear nuclear complex. Only injections

along a rostrocaudal band in the DCN, matching the anatomical projection

of tuberculoventral neurons, evoke IPSPs; elsewhere, there were no

responses to the glutamate. The inhibition is blocked by 0.5 microM

strychnine. Both bushy and stellate cells are targets of the inhibitory

projection. Inhibition in the AVCN is delayed by an additional synaptic

delay with respect to the excitation. Delayed, frequency-specific

inhibition allows the first wavefront to be transmitted to higher

auditory centers by bushy and stellate cells, while following inputs

encoding signals of similar frequencies are attenuated at least for

the duration of an IPSP. These findings are consistent with results

from psychoacoustic experiments and suggest that this circuit provides

a source of monaural echo suppression.},

abstract = {Recent developments in multi-electrode recordings enable the simultaneous

measurement of the spiking activity of many neurons. Analysis of

such multineuronal data is one of the key challenge in computational

neuroscience today. In this work, we develop a multivariate point-process

model in which the observed activity of a network of neurons depends

on three terms: (1) the experimentally-controlled stimulus; (2) the

spiking history of the observed neurons; and (3) a hidden term that

corresponds, for example, to common input from an unobserved population

of neurons that is presynaptic to two or more cells in the observed

population. We consider two models for the network firing-rates,

one of which is computationally and analytically tractable but can

lead to unrealistically high firing-rates, while the other with reasonable

firing-rates imposes a greater computational burden. We develop an

expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting the parameters of

both the models. For the analytically tractable model the expectation

step is based on a continuous-time implementation of the extended

Kalman smoother, and the maximization step involves two concave maximization

problems which may be solved in parallel. The other model that we

consider necessitates the use of Monte Carlo methods for the expectation

as well as maximization step. We discuss the trade-off involved in

choosing between the two models and the associated methods. The techniques

developed allow us to solve a variety of inference problems in a

straightforward, computationally efficient fashion; for example,

we may use the model to predict network activity given an arbitrary

stimulus, infer a neuron's ring rate given the stimulus and the activity

of the other observed neurons, and perform optimal stimulus decoding

and prediction. We present several detailed simulation studies which

explore the strengths and limitations of our approach.},

We then applied a decoding algorithm to estimate which sequence was being represented by the ensemble activity in prefrontal cortex. We found that the sequence predicted by this analysis changed gradually from the sequence that had been correct in the previous block to the sequence that was correct in the current block, closely following the fraction of executed movements that were consistent with the corresponding sequence. Thus, the neural activity dynamically tracked the monkeys' uncertainty about the correct sequence of actions.

abstract = {Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques enable extraordinarily sensitive and specific in vivo study of the structure, functional response and connectivity of biological mechanisms. With these advanced methods comes a heavy reliance on computer-based processing, analysis and interpretation. While the neuroimaging community has produced many excellent academic and commercial tool packages, new tools are often required to interpret new modalities and paradigms. Developing custom tools and ensuring interoperability with existing tools is a significant hurdle. To address these limitations, we present a new framework for algorithm development that implicitly ensures tool interoperability, generates graphical user interfaces, provides advanced batch processing tools, and, most importantly, requires minimal additional programming or computational overhead. Java-based rapid prototyping with this system is an efficient and practical approach to evaluate new algorithms since the proposed system ensures that rapidly constructed prototypes are actually fully-functional processing modules with support for multiple GUI's, a broad range of file formats, and distributed computation. Herein, we demonstrate MRI image processing with the proposed system for cortical surface extraction in large cross-sectional cohorts, provide a system for fully automated diffusion tensor image analysis, and illustrate how the system can be used as a simulation framework for the development of a new image analysis method. The system is released as open source under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) through the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC).},

abstract = {Initial analysis of interaural temporal disparities (ITDs), a cue for sound localization, occurs in the superior olivary complex. The medial superior olive (MSO) receives excitatory input from the left and right cochlear nuclei. Its neurons are believed to be coincidence detectors, discharging when input arrives simultaneously from the two sides. Many current psychophysical models assume a strict version of coincidence, in which neurons of the MSO cross correlate their left and right inputs. However, there have been few tests of this assumption. Here we examine data derived from two earlier studies of the MSO and compare the responses to the output of a computational model. We find that the MSO is not an ideal cross correlator. Ideal cross correlation implies a strict relationship between the precision of phase-locking of the inputs and the range of ITDs to which a neuron responds. This relationship does not appear to be met. Instead, the modeling implies that a neuron responds over a wider range of ITDs than expected from the inferred precision of phase-locking of the inputs. The responses are more consistent with a scheme in which the neuron can also be activated by the input from one side alone. Such activation degrades the tuning of neurons in the MSO to ITDs.},

abstract = {Hippocampal area CA3 is widely considered to function as an autoassociative memory. However, it is insufficiently understood how it does so. In particular, the extensive experimental evidence for the importance of carefully regulated spiking times poses the question as to how spike timing-based dynamics may support memory functions. Here, we develop a normative theory of autoassociative memory encompassing such network dynamics. Our theory specifies the way that the synaptic plasticity rule of a memory constrains the form of neuronal interactions that will retrieve memories optimally. If memories are stored by spike timing-dependent plasticity, neuronal interactions should be formalized in terms of a phase response curve, indicating the effect of presynaptic spikes on the timing of postsynaptic spikes. We show through simulation that such memories are competent analog autoassociators and demonstrate directly that the attributes of phase response curves of CA3 pyramidal cells recorded in vitro qualitatively conform with the theory.},

In this paper, we present a new algorithm for testing global identifiability of nonlinear dynamic models, based on differential algebra. The characteristic set associated to the dynamic equations is calculated in an efficient way and computer algebra techniques are used to solve the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The algorithm is capable of handling many features arising in biological system models, including zero initial conditions and time-varying parameters. Examples of usage of the algorithm for analyzing a priori global identifiability of nonlinear models of biological and physiological systems are presented.},

abstract = {Negative environmental consequences of fossil fuels and concerns about petroleum supplies have spurred the search for renewable transportation biofuels. To be a viable alternative, a biofuel should provide a net energy gain, have environmental benefits, be economically competitive, and be producible in large quantities without reducing food supplies. We use these criteria to evaluate, through life-cycle accounting, ethanol from corn grain and biodiesel from soybeans. Ethanol yields 25\% more energy than the energy invested in its production, whereas biodiesel yields 93\% more. Compared with ethanol, biodiesel releases just 1.0\%, 8.3\%, and 13\% of the agricultural nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide pollutants, respectively, per net energy gain. Relative to the fossil fuels they displace, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced 12\% by the production and combustion of ethanol and 41\% by biodiesel. Biodiesel also releases less air pollutants per net energy gain than ethanol. These advantages of biodiesel over ethanol come from lower agricultural inputs and more efficient conversion of feedstocks to fuel. Neither biofuel can replace much petroleum without impacting food supplies. Even dedicating all U.S. corn and soybean production to biofuels would meet only 12\% of gasoline demand and 6\% of diesel demand. Until recent increases in petroleum prices, high production costs made biofuels unprofitable without subsidies. Biodiesel provides sufficient environmental advantages to merit subsidy. Transportation biofuels such as synfuel hydrocarbons or cellulosic ethanol, if produced from low-input biomass grown on agriculturally marginal land or from waste biomass, could provide much greater supplies and environmental benefits than food-based biofuels.},

abstract = {Exposure of adults to loud noise can overstimulate the auditory system,

damage the cochlea, and destroy cochlear nerve axons and their synaptic

endings in the brain. Cochlear nerve loss probably results from the

death of cochlear inner hair cells (IHC). Additional degeneration

in the cochlear nucleus (CN) is hypothesized to stem from overstimulation

of the system, which may produce excitotoxicity. This study tested

these predictions by exposing one ear of anesthetized adult chinchillas

to a loud noise, which damaged the ipsilateral cochlea and induced

degeneration in the glutamatergic cochlear nerve. During the first

postexposure week, before cochlear nerve axons degenerated, glutamatergic

synaptic release in the ipsilateral CN was elevated and uptake was

depressed, consistent with hyperactivity of glutamatergic transmission

and perhaps with the operation of an excitotoxic mechanism. By 14

days, when cochlear nerve fibers degenerated, glutamatergic synaptic

release and uptake in the CN became deficient. By 90 days, a resurgence

of transmitter release and an elevation of AMPA receptor binding

suggested transmission upregulation through plasticity that resembled

changes after mechanical cochlear damage. These changes may contribute

to tinnitus and other pathologic symptoms that precede and accompany

hearing loss. In contrast, the other ear, protected with a silicone

plug during the noise exposure, exhibited virtually no damage in

the cochlea or the cochlear nerve. Altered glutamatergic release

and AMPA receptor binding activity in the CN suggested upregulatory

plasticity driven by signals emanating from the CN on the noise-exposed

side.},

Low intensity, long duration laser irradiation produces a sustained depolarization, insensitive to sodium channel blockers yet sensitive to antioxidants. On the other hand, high intensity, short duration irradiation can induce fast depolarizations, which appear due to different mechanism.

This approach allows for quantitative comparison of operations of neural junctions across systems, and an interpretation of their connectivity parameters in terms of the flow of multiunit firing patterns. The paper further uses this characterization to show how to rationally construct reduced operational models of neural junctions. Both uniformly proportional scaling and partial fragmentary representations are developed. The uniformly scaled models are better adapted to overall capacities and broader theoretical conceptualizations; the partial representations are better adapted to direct comparison with microelectrode experimentation. The characterization of information flow is based on coordinated multiunit patterns such as synfire chains or sequential configurations. The system can be applied to component parts of large composite networks including junctions with topographical patchiness and other irregularities. The characterization should be of use to anatomists, physiologists, modelers, and theorists. The theory predicts that the necessity for cooperative confluence of synaptic potentials in sending and receiving sequential configurations across topographically constrained projection fields requires the existence of functional 'pattern modules' within the topographical synaptology of the junction.},

During the last decades, however, a theory has been developed that allows the sample space to be some abstract space. More recently, mathematical techniquesespecially the method of sieveshave been constructed to enable inferences to be made in abstract parameter spaces. This work began with the authors 1950 monograph on inference in stochastic processes (for general sample space) and with the sieve methodology (for general parameter space) that the author and his co-workers at Brown University developed in the 1970s. Both of these cases are studied in this volume, which is the first comprehensive treatment of the subject. 1980 Order Statistics, 2nd Ed. Herbert A.

abstract = {In this paper, we prove constructively two approximative versions
of the superposition theorem of Kolmogorov (19631, corresponding
to Lorentz (1962) and Sprecher (1965). The proofs are constructive
in the sense that only rationals, expressible as finite decimal sums,
are used. The approximations consist in algorithms with error bounds.
Concerning their complexity, the two results differ in the way the
occurring sequences are constructed: recursively, respectively explicitly.},
annote = {This paper provides relatively clear proof-by-construction of approximate
version of Kolmogorov theorem, which states that any n-dimensional
function can be represented as a sum of 2n+1 1D functions of sums
of n fixed functions with different coefficients (total of n+1 parameters).
In nut-shell, Kolmogorov theorem is analog of the statement that
any function of n-dimensional index Z\^{}n is isomorphic to a function
of 1D index via Z\^{}n->Z. In general, simple index mapping Z\^{}n->Z is
not continuous as step-discontinuities arise along each "line" of
the mapping. Kolmogorov's achievement was to provide a construction
which contribute a continuous map [0,1]\^{}n->[0,1]. Such mapping is
constructed by finding families of 2n+1 coverings of n-cube of decreasing
diameter and vanishing overlaps within each family such that each
point is covered by at least n+1 cubes from these coverings. One
then is able to construct continuous functions that map each of such
cubes non-overlaping cubes into distinct points of the [0,1] line
(!). Therefore, [0,1]\^{}n is continuously mapped 1-1 onto [0,1] and
any continuous function of [0,1]\^{}n can be seen as (some) continuous
function of the image of [0,1]\^{}n. Some subtleties are present requiring
2n+1 such functions each approximating on a subset of n coverings
at a time. Note that dimensionality curse is not removed since complexity
of R\^{}n space is translated into extremely complex mapping into R,
and thus, generally, no gain is achieved for actual interpolation.},

abstract = {Sensory stimuli entering the nervous system follow particular paths of processing, typically separated (segregated) from the paths of other modal information. However, sensory perception, awareness and cognition emerge from the combination of information (integration). The corticocortical networks of cats and macaque monkeys display three prominent characteristics: (i) modular organisation (facilitating the segregation), (ii) abundant alternative processing paths and (iii) the presence of highly connected hubs. Here, we study in detail the organisation and potential function of the cortical hubs by graph analysis and information theoretical methods. We find that the cortical hubs form a spatially delocalised, but topologically central module with the capacity to integrate multisensory information in a collaborative manner. With this, we resolve the underlying anatomical substrate that supports the simultaneous capacity of the cortex to segregate and to integrate multisensory information.},

Ras activity spread over approximately 10 micrometers of dendrite

signaling was necessary for the local regulation of the threshold
for LTP induction. Thus, Ca2+-dependent synaptic signals can spread
to couple multiple synapses on short stretches of dendrite.},

@article{Willmore2001,
abstract = {It is often suggested that efficient neural codes for natural visual information should be 'sparse'. However, the term 'sparse' has been used in two different ways--firstly to describe codes in which few neurons are active at any time ('population sparseness'), and secondly to describe codes in which each neuron's lifetime response distribution has high kurtosis ('lifetime sparseness'). Although these ideas are related, they are not identical, and the most common measure of lifetime sparseness--the kurtosis of the lifetime response distributions of the neurons--provides no information about population sparseness. We have measured the population sparseness and lifetime kurtosis of several biologically inspired coding schemes. We used three measures of population sparseness (population kurtosis, Treves-Rolls sparseness and 'activity sparseness'), and found them to be in close agreement with one another. However, we also measured the lifetime kurtosis of the cells in each code. We found that lifetime kurtosis is uncorrelated with population sparseness for the codes we used. Lifetime kurtosis is not, therefore, a useful measure of the population sparseness of a code. Moreover, the Gabor-like codes, which are often assumed to have high population sparseness (since they have high lifetime kurtosis), actually turned out to have rather low population sparseness. Surprisingly, principal components filters produced the codes with the highest population sparseness.},

abstract = {Measuring variations of intracellular free calcium concentration through
the changes in fluorescence of a calcium-sensitive dye is a ubiquitous
technique in neuroscience. Despite its popularity, confidence intervals
(CIs) on the estimated parameters of calcium dynamics models are
seldom given. To address this issue, we have developed a two-stage
model for ratiometric measurements obtained with a charge-coupled
device (CCD) camera. Its first element embeds a parametric calcium
dynamics model into a fluorescence intensity model and its second
element probabilistically describes the fluorescence measurements
by a CCD camera. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we first show that
the classical ratiometric transformation gives reliable CIs for time
constants only and not baseline calcium concentration nor influx.
We then introduce a direct method, which consists of fitting directly
and simultaneously the fluorescence transients at both wavelengths,
without any data ratioing. This approach uses a probabilistic description
of the camera, leading to the construction of meaningful CIs for
the calcium parameters. Moreover, using approaches inspired by constrained
linear regression, we can take into account the finite precision
on calibrated parameters (such as the dye dissociation constant in
the cell). These key features are illustrated on simulated data using
Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, we illustrate the strength of
the direct method on experimental recordings from insect olfactory
interneurons. In particular, we show how to handle a time-dependent
buffer concentration, thereby considerably improving our goodness
of fit. The direct method was implemented in the open-source software
R and is freely distributed in the CalciOMatic package.},

abstract = {The objective of inter-subject registration of three-dimensional volumetric brain scans is to reduce the anatomical variability between the images scanned from different individuals. This is a necessary step in many different applications such as voxelwise group analysis of imaging data obtained from different individuals. In this paper, the ability of three different image registration algorithms in reducing inter-subject anatomical variability is quantitatively compared using a set of common high-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging scans from 17 subjects. The algorithms are from the automatic image registration (AIR; version 5), the statistical parametric mapping (SPM99), and the automatic registration toolbox (ART) packages. The latter includes the implementation of a non-linear image registration algorithm, details of which are presented in this paper. The accuracy of registration is quantified in terms of two independent measures: (1) post-registration spatial dispersion of sets of homologous landmarks manually identified on images before or after registration; and (2) voxelwise image standard deviation maps computed within the set of images registered by each algorithm. Both measures showed that the ART algorithm is clearly superior to both AIR and SPM99 in reducing inter-subject anatomical variability. The spatial dispersion measure was found to be more sensitive when the landmarks were placed after image registration. The standard deviation measure was found sensitive to intensity normalization or the method of image interpolation.},

Sci. 360(1457) 983-993], a particular case of the Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs) was used to model the dynamic behavior of the BOLD response in functional MRI. This state-space model, called bilinear dynamical system (BDS), is used to deconvolve the fMRI time series in order to estimate the neuronal response induced by the different stimuli of the experimental paradigm. The BDS model parameters are estimated using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm proposed by Ghahramani and Hinton [Ghahramani, Z., Hinton, G.E. 1996. Parameter Estimation for Linear Dynamical Systems. Technical Report, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto]. In this paper we introduce modifications to the BDS model in order to explicitly model the spatial variations of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) in the brain using a non-parametric approach. While in Penny et al. [Penny, W., Ghahramani, Z., Friston, K.J. 2005. Bilinear dynamical systems. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 360(1457) 983-993] the relationship between neuronal activation and fMRI signals is formulated as a first-order convolution with a kernel expansion using basis functions (typically two or three), in this paper, we argue in favor of a spatially adaptive GLM in which a local non-parametric estimation of the HRF is performed. Furthermore, in order to overcome the overfitting problem typically associated with simple EM estimates, we propose a full Variational Bayes (VB) solution to infer the BDS model parameters. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model which is able to estimate both the neuronal activity and the haemodynamic response function in every voxel of the brain. We first examine the behavior of this approach when applied to simulated data with different temporal and noise features. As an example we will show how this method can be used to improve interpretability of estimates from an independent component analysis (ICA) analysis of fMRI data. We finally demonstrate its use on real fMRI data in one slice of the brain.},

abstract = {Cooperative processes, or algorithms, are procedures that generate
large-scale, or global, effects through sequences of small-scale,
or local, operations. Such procedures underlie life as we know it.
They are encountered in a variety of physical and chemical systems,
and are found in biological systems at all levels of organization.
In a cooperative system, global computations are performed by many
units operating in parallel. Cooperativity emerges in these systems
through interactions among component units. Each unit generates a
new state from its previous one by combining information available
internally with signals received from neighboring units and from
outside. This article considers cooperativity and parallelism in
two classes of mathematical models of brain function developed by
researchers in the field over the past 10 to 15 years. The human
brain, containing approximately 1011 neurons and perhaps as many
as 1015 distinct synaptic connections, is the archetype of a highly
cooperative, massively parallel system. The first class of models
and accompanying solution methods were constructed to carry out tasks
in perceptual inferencing, such as the segmentation of a scene into
its component surfaces, figure\^{A}–ground segregation, and object recognition.
In these computer-based approaches we construct a Markov random field
(MRF) to capture correlations in a visual image and then use simulated
annealing, or one of its siblings, to generate sequences of small
changes. The solution methods are stochastic in character; the computations
are intrinsically parallel and are inspired by our thinking about
how the early stages of visual processing might occur in the brain.
The second class of mathematical models and methods has as its central
theme the notion of assembly coding. These models and methods were
developed to carry out the same tasks as those in the first class,
but we now construct families of coupled first-order ordinary differential
equations that describe circuits of interconnected neurons. We then
evolve these nonlinear dynamical systems through sequences of states
that converge to fixed points, limit cycles, or chaotic attractors.
The solution methods can be either deterministic or stochastic; the
computations are parallel and highly distributed, and they model
circuits found in the mammalian brain.},

abstract = {A central question in neuroscience is how interactions between neurons give rise to behavior. In many electrophysiological experiments, the activity of a set of neurons is recorded while sensory stimuli or movement tasks are varied. Tools that aim to reveal underlying interactions between neurons from such data can be extremely useful. Traditionally, neuroscientists have studied these interactions using purely descriptive statistics (cross-correlograms or joint peri-stimulus time histograms). However, the interpretation of such data is often difficult, particularly as the number of recorded neurons grows. Recent research suggests that model-based, maximum likelihood methods can improve these analyses. In addition to estimating neural interactions, application of these techniques has improved decoding of external variables, created novel interpretations of existing electrophysiological data, and may provide new insight into how the brain represents information.},

abstract = {Humans are an unusually prosocial species-we vote, give blood, recycle, give tithes and punish violators of social norms. Experimental evidence indicates that people willingly incur costs to help strangers in anonymous one-shot interactions, and that altruistic behaviour is motivated, at least in part, by empathy and concern for the welfare of others (hereafter referred to as other-regarding preferences). In contrast, cooperative behaviour in non-human primates is mainly limited to kin and reciprocating partners, and is virtually never extended to unfamiliar individuals. Here we present experimental tests of the existence of other-regarding preferences in non-human primates, and show that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) do not take advantage of opportunities to deliver benefits to familiar individuals at no material cost to themselves, suggesting that chimpanzee behaviour is not motivated by other-regarding preferences. Chimpanzees are among the primates most likely to demonstrate prosocial behaviours. They participate in a variety of collective activities, including territorial patrols, coalitionary aggression, cooperative hunting, food sharing and joint mate guarding. Consolation of victims of aggression and anecdotal accounts of solicitous treatment of injured individuals suggest that chimpanzees may feel empathy. Chimpanzees sometimes reject exchanges in which they receive less valuable rewards than others, which may be one element of a 'sense of fairness', but there is no evidence that they are averse to interactions in which they benefit more than others.},

@article{Caithness2004,
abstract = {An influential idea in human motor learning is that there is a consolidation period during which motor memories are transformed from a fragile to a permanent state, no longer susceptible to interference from new learning. The evidence supporting this idea comes from studies showing that the motor memory of a task (A) is lost when an opposing task (B) is experienced soon after, but not if sufficient time is allowed to pass (approximately 6 hr). We report results from three laboratories challenging this consolidation idea. We used an ABA paradigm in the context of a reaching task to assess the influence of experiencing B after A on the retention of A. In two experiments using visuomotor rotations, we found that B fully interferes with the retention of A even when B is experienced 24 hr after A. Contrary to previous reports, in four experiments on learning force fields, we also observed full interference between A and B when they are separated by 24 hr or even 1 week. This latter result holds for both position-dependent and velocity-dependent force fields. For both the visuomotor and force-field tasks, complete interference is still observed when the possible affects of anterograde interference are controlled through the use of washout trials. Our results fail to support the idea that motor memories become consolidated into a protected state. Rather, they are consistent with recent ideas of memory formation, which propose that memories can shift between active and inactive states.},

abstract = {The six-layered mammalian neocortex evolved from the three-layered
paleocortex, which is retained in present-day reptiles such as the
turtle. Thus the turtle offers an opportunity to examine which cellular
and circuit properties are fundamental to cortical function. We characterized
the dendritic properties of pyramidal neurons in different cortical
regions of mature turtles, Pseudemys scripta elegans, using whole
cell recordings and calcium imaging from the axon, soma, and dendrites
in a slice preparation. The firing properties, in response to intrasomatic
depolarization, resembled those previously recorded with sharp electrodes
in this preparation. Somatic spikes led to active backpropagating
high-amplitude dendritic action potentials and intracellular calcium
ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes at all dendritic locations, suggesting
that both backpropagation and dendritic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
are primitive traits. We found no indication that Ca2+ spikes could
be evoked in the dendrites, but fast Na+ spikes could be initiated
there following intradendritic stimulation. Several lines of evidence
indicate that fast, smaller-amplitude somatic spikes ("prepotentials")
that are easily recorded in this preparation are generated in the
axon. Most synaptically activated [Ca2+]i changes resulted from Ca2+
entry through voltage-gated channels. In some cells synaptic stimulation
evoked a delayed Ca2+ wave due to release from internal stores following
activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. With some small differences
these properties resemble those of pyramidal neurons in mammalian
species. We conclude that spike backpropagation, dendritic Ca2+ channels,
and synaptically activated Ca2+ release are primitive and conserved
features of cortical pyramidal cells, and therefore likely fundamental
to cortical function.},

abstract = {Animals from flies to humans are able to distinguish subtle gradations in temperature and show strong temperature preferences. Animals move to environments of optimal temperature and some manipulate the temperature of their surroundings, as humans do using clothing and shelter. Despite the ubiquitous influence of environmental temperature on animal behaviour, the neural circuits and strategies through which animals select a preferred temperature remain largely unknown. Here we identify a small set of warmth-activated anterior cell (AC) neurons located in the Drosophila brain, the function of which is critical for preferred temperature selection. AC neuron activation occurs just above the fly's preferred temperature and depends on dTrpA1, an ion channel that functions as a molecular sensor of warmth. Flies that selectively express dTrpA1 in the AC neurons select normal temperatures, whereas flies in which dTrpA1 function is reduced or eliminated choose warmer temperatures. This internal warmth-sensing pathway promotes avoidance of slightly elevated temperatures and acts together with a distinct pathway for cold avoidance to set the fly's preferred temperature. Thus, flies select a preferred temperature by using a thermal sensing pathway tuned to trigger avoidance of temperatures that deviate even slightly from the preferred temperature. This provides a potentially general strategy for robustly selecting a narrow temperature range optimal for survival.},

in several reg- ularization and renormalization prescriptions and

The beta function in the broken phase becomes neg- ative and the
UV fixed point turns out to be a strong-coupling one, and its numeric
value varies with the renormalization prescriptions, a detail which
is different from the asymptotic free solution in the one loop case.
The symmetry breaking phase is shown to be an entirely strong-coupling
phase. The reason of the relevance of the renormalization prescriptions
is shown to be due to the nonperturbative nature of the effective
potential. We also reanalyzed the two loop effective potential by
adopting a differential equation approach based on the understanding
that takes all the QFT\"{\i}¾’s as the ill-defined formulations of the
\"{\i}¾’low energy\"{\i}¾’ effective theories of a complete under- lying theory.
Then the relevance of the prescriptions of fixing the local ambiguities
to physical properties like symmetry breaking is further emphasized.
We also tenta- tively proposed a rescaling insensitivity argument
for fixing the quadratic ambiguities. Some detailed properties of
the strongly coupled broken phase and related issues were discussed.},

abstract = {The axon collaterals of dentate granule cells have been analyzed with
the aid of a computerized microscope, following intracellular injections
of horseradish peroxidase in hippocampal slice preparations. The
axon of each granule cell gives rise to approximately seven primary
collaterals; these collaterals usually divide into secondary and
tertiary branches, which form an extensive plexus within the hilar
region of the dentate gyrus. Individual axon collaterals vary greatly
in length, but most have been found to be between 100 and 300 microns
long. On average, the summed lengths of the collaterals (exclusive
of the parent mossy fiber) are approximately 2,300 microns. Except
for an occasional collateral that is given off by a mossy fiber in
the proximal part of field CA3 of the hippocampus, the collaterals
of the granule cell axons are confined to the hilar region; they
are rarely seen in the granule cell layer itself and have never been
observed in the molecular layer. In the longitudinal dimension of
the dentate gyrus, most of the collaterals are contained within a
zone about 400 microns wide. The distribution of the collaterals
within the hilar region is correlated with the location of the granule
cell body. Those that arise from cells near the tip of the suprapyramidal
blade tend to be confined to the region above field CA3; those from
cells nearer the crest and from the infrapyramidal blade ramify widely
throughout the hilus. Two types of varicosities are present on the
collaterals. Numerous small (approximately 2 microns), round varicosities
are distributed unevenly along the collaterals; in electron micrographs
these varicosities can be seen to make asymmetric synaptic contacts
with dendritic shafts. On average, each granule cell collateral plexus
has about 160 of these varicosities. The second type of varicosity
is irregular in shape and ranges from 2 to 4 microns in diameter;
there is usually only one such varicosity per collateral. In all
respects except size, these varicosities resemble the expansions
found on the parent mossy fibers. Mossy fiber trajectories in the
proximal part of field CA3 were studied after extracellular injections
of HRP into localized regions of the granule cell layer. Granule
cells at different locations around the blade send their mossy fibers
to different depths within the pyramidal cell layer in the proximal
part of field CA3. However, further distally, mossy fibers from all
parts of the granule cell layer contribute to the suprapyramidal
bundle that occupies the stratum lucidum.},

abstract = {Recent advances in Kalman filtering to estimate system state and parameters in nonlinear systems have offered the potential to apply such approaches to spatiotemporal nonlinear systems. We here adapt the nonlinear method of unscented Kalman filtering to observe the state and estimate parameters in a computational spatiotemporal excitable system that serves as a model for cerebral cortex. We demonstrate the ability to track spiral wave dynamics, and to use an observer system to calculate control signals delivered through applied electrical fields. We demonstrate how this strategy can control the frequency of such a system, or quench the wave patterns, while minimizing the energy required for such results. These findings are readily testable in experimental applications, and have the potential to be applied to the treatment of human disease.},

abstract = {The mammalian auditory system is the temporally most precise sensory modality: To localize low-frequency sounds in space, the binaural system can resolve time differences between the ears with microsecond precision. In contrast, the binaural system appears sluggish in tracking changing interaural time differences as they arise from a low-frequency sound source moving along the horizontal plane. For a combined psychophysical and electrophysiological approach, we created a binaural stimulus, called "Phasewarp," that can transmit rapid changes in interaural timing. Using this stimulus, the binaural performance in humans is significantly better than reported previously and comparable with the monaural performance revealed with amplitude-modulated stimuli. Parallel, electrophysiological recordings of binaural brainstem neurons in the gerbil show fast temporal processing of monaural and different types of binaural modulations. In a refined electrophysiological approach that was matched to the psychophysics, the seemingly faster binaural processing of the Phasewarp was confirmed. The current data provide both psychophysical and physiological evidence against a general, hard-wired binaural sluggishness and reconcile previous contradictions of electrophysiological and psychophysical estimates of temporal binaural performance.},

abstract = {Estimation of noise-induced variability in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is needed to objectively follow disease progression in therapeutic monitoring and to provide consistent readouts of pathophysiology. The noise variability of nonlinear quantities of the diffusion tensor (e.g., fractional anisotropy, fiber orientation, etc.) have been quantified using the bootstrap, in which the data are resampled from the experimental averages, yet this approach is only applicable to DTI scans that contain multiple averages from the same sampling direction. It has been shown that DTI acquisitions with a modest to large number of directions, in which each direction is only sampled once, outperform the multiple averages approach. These acquisitions resist the traditional (regular) bootstrap analysis though. In contrast to the regular bootstrap, the wild bootstrap method can be applied to such protocols in which there is only one observation per direction. Here, we compare and contrast the wild bootstrap with the regular bootstrap using Monte Carlo numerical simulations for a number of diffusion scenarios. The regular and wild bootstrap methods are applied to human DTI data and empirical distributions are obtained for fractional anisotropy and the diffusion tensor eigensystem. Spatial maps of the estimated variability in the diffusion tensor principal eigenvector are provided. The wild bootstrap method can provide empirical distributions for tensor-derived quantities, such as fractional anisotropy and principal eigenvector direction, even when the exact distributions are not easily derived.},

abstract = {It has been well known that gender plays a critical role in the anatomy and function of the human brain, as well as human behaviors. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated gender effects on not only focal brain areas but also the connectivity between areas. Specifically, structural MRI and diffusion MRI data have revealed substantial gender differences in white matter-based anatomical connectivity. Structural MRI data further demonstrated gender differences in the connectivity revealed by morphometric correlation among brain areas. Functional connectivity derived from functional neuroimaging (e.g., functional MRI and PET) data is also modulated by gender. Moreover, male and female human brains display differences in the network topology that represents the organizational patterns of brain connectivity across the entire brain. In this review, the authors summarize recent findings in the multimodal brain connectivity/network research with gender, focusing on large-scale data sets derived from modern neuroimaging techniques. The literature provides convergent evidence for a substantial gender difference in brain connectivity within the human brain that possibly underlies gender-related cognitive differences. Therefore, it should be mandatory to take gender into account when designing experiments or interpreting results of brain connectivity/network in health and disease. Future studies will likely be conducted to explore the interdependence between gender-related brain connectivity/network and the gender-specific nature of brain diseases as well as to investigate gender-related characteristics of multimodal brain connectivity/network in the normal brain.},

abstract = {We used rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) to examine the tuning of macaque inferior temporal cortical (IT) neurons to five sets of 25 shapes each that varied systematically along predefined shape dimensions. A comparison of the RSVP technique using 100-ms presentations with that using a longer duration showed that shape preference can be determined with RSVP. Using relatively complex shapes that vary along relatively simple shape dimensions, we found that the large majority of neurons preferred extremes of the shape configuration, extending the results of a previous study using simpler shapes and a standard testing paradigm. A population analysis of the neuronal responses demonstrated that, in general, IT neurons can represent the similarities among the shapes at an ordinal level, extending a previous study that used a smaller number of shapes and a categorization task. However, the same analysis showed that IT neurons do not faithfully represent the physical similarities among the shapes. The responses to the two-part shapes could be predicted, virtually perfectly, from the average of the responses to the respective two parts presented in isolation. We also showed that IT neurons adapt to the stimulus distribution statistics. The neural shape discrimination improved when a shape set with a narrower stimulus range was presented, suggesting that the tuning of IT neurons is not static but adapts to the stimulus distribution statistics, at least when stimulated at a high rate with a restricted set of stimuli.},

abstract = {Genetically encoded Ca(2+) sensors promise sustained in vivo detection
of Ca(2+) signals. However, these sensors are sometimes challenged
by inconsistent performance and slow/uncertain kinetic responsiveness.
The former challenge may arise because most sensors employ calmodulin
(CaM) as the Ca(2+)-sensing module, such that interference via endogenous
CaM may result. One class of sensors that could minimize this concern
utilizes troponin C as the Ca(2+) sensor. Here, we therefore probed
the reliability and kinetics of one representative of this class
(CFP/YFP-FRET sensor TN-L15) within cardiac ventricular myocytes.
These cells furnished a pertinent live-cell test environment, given
substantial endogenous CaM levels and fast reproducible Ca(2+) transients
for testing sensor kinetics. TN-L15 was virally expressed within
myocytes, and Indo-1 acutely loaded to monitor 'true' Ca(2+) transients.
This configuration permitted independent and simultaneous detection
of TN-L15 and Indo 1 signals within individual cells. The relation
between TN-L15 FRET responses and Indo-1 Ca(2+) transients appeared
reproducible, though FRET signals were delayed compared to Ca(2+)
transients. Nonetheless, a three state mechanism sufficed to map
between measured Ca(2+) transients and actual TN-L15 outputs. Overall,
reproducibility of TN-L15 dynamics, coupled with algorithmic transforms
between FRET and Ca(2+) signals, renders these sensors promising
for quantitative estimation of Ca(2+) dynamics in vivo.},

The transverse patterning task, (A+B-, B+C-, C+A-), requires representing individual stimuli in the context of other stimuli. This paper extends a previous application to rat data [INNS World Congress on Neural Networks, 1995; Biol Cybern 6 (1998a) 203] by applying a model of the CA3 region of the hippocampus to human data. A decision function is also added that enables the system to choose among training items. Analysis of the simulations show that configural representations are formed by unique neural codes that depend on temporal and stimuli context. Based on the simulations, we hypothesize that configural representations in biological networks depend on a proper balance of input and context representations. Furthermore, the division of labor between functions in the model is a specific working hypothesis that in learning this task the hippocampus specializes in sequence prediction and the decision function evaluates the predictions.},

abstract = {Locations of a distinctive mode of trans-endocytosis involving dendrites,
axons, and glia were quantified through serial section electron microscopy.
Short vesicular or long vermiform evaginations emerged from dendrites
and axons and were engulfed by presynaptic or neighboring axons,
astrocytes, and, surprisingly, a growth cone to form double-membrane
structures called spinules. In total, 254 spinules were evaluated
in 326 micron\^{}3 of stratum radiatum in area CA1 of mature rat hippocampus.
Spinules emerged from spine heads (62\%), necks (24\%), axons (13\%),
dendritic shafts (1\%), or nonsynaptic protrusions (<1\%) and invaginated
into axons (<90\%), astrocytic processes (<8\%), or a growth cone (<1\%).
Coated pits occurred on the engulfing membrane at the tips of most
spinules ( 69\%), and double-membrane structures occurred freely in
axonal and astrocytic cytoplasm, suggesting trans-endocytosis. Spinule
locations differed among mushroom and thin spines. For mushroom spines,
most (84\%) of the spinules were engulfed by presynaptic axons, 16\%
by neighboring axons, and none by astrocytic processes. At thin spines,
only 17\% of the spinules were engulfed by presynaptic axons, whereas
67\% were engulfed by neighboring axons and 14\% by astrocytic processes.
Spinules engulfed by astrocytic processes support the growing evidence
that perisynaptic glia interact directly with synapses at least on
thin spines. Spinules with neighboring axons may provide a mechanism
for synaptic competition in the mature brain. Trans-endocytosis of
spinules by presynaptic axons suggest retrograde signaling or coordinated
remodeling of presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes to remove transient
perforations and assemble the postsynaptic density of large synapses
on mushroom spines.},

abstract = {Circuitry mapping of metazoan neural systems is difficult because canonical neural regions (regions containing one or more copies of all components) are large, regional borders are uncertain, neuronal diversity is high, and potential network topologies so numerous that only anatomical ground truth can resolve them. Complete mapping of a specific network requires synaptic resolution, canonical region coverage, and robust neuronal classification. Though transmission electron microscopy (TEM) remains the optimal tool for network mapping, the process of building large serial section TEM (ssTEM) image volumes is rendered difficult by the need to precisely mosaic distorted image tiles and register distorted mosaics. Moreover, most molecular neuronal class markers are poorly compatible with optimal TEM imaging. Our objective was to build a complete framework for ultrastructural circuitry mapping. This framework combines strong TEM-compliant small molecule profiling with automated image tile mosaicking, automated slice-to-slice image registration, and gigabyte-scale image browsing for volume annotation. Specifically we show how ultrathin molecular profiling datasets and their resultant classification maps can be embedded into ssTEM datasets and how scripted acquisition tools (SerialEM), mosaicking and registration (ir-tools), and large slice viewers (MosaicBuilder, Viking) can be used to manage terabyte-scale volumes. These methods enable large-scale connectivity analyses of new and legacy data. In well-posed tasks (e.g., complete network mapping in retina), terabyte-scale image volumes that previously would require decades of assembly can now be completed in months. Perhaps more importantly, the fusion of molecular profiling, image acquisition by SerialEM, ir-tools volume assembly, and data viewers/annotators also allow ssTEM to be used as a prospective tool for discovery in nonneural systems and a practical screening methodology for neurogenetics. Finally, this framework provides a mechanism for parallelization of ssTEM imaging, volume assembly, and data analysis across an international user base, enhancing the productivity of a large cohort of electron microscopists.},

abstract = {Intracellular recordings were made from neurons of the guinea pig

dorsal cochlear nucleus in an in vitro brain slice preparation. The

membrane properties of the cells were studied, and the membrane potentials

were manipulated by current injection to determine how intrinsic

conductances might alter the cell discharge patterns. Eleven cells

were marked with Lucifer yellow. Ten of these cells were identified

as the large pyramidal cells of layer 2 of this nucleus, and 1 cell

was identified as a "vertical" cell in layer 3. Two kinds of action

potentials were observed: simple spikes and complex spikes. This

report discusses only cells with simple spikes. Simple spiking cells

(60/72 recorded cells; all stained cells were simple spiking cells)

discharged in a regular fashion with depolarization, and had linear

frequency-current relationships up to 2 nA with a mean slope of 116

Hz/nA. The discharge rate was approximately constant throughout the

current pulse. Responses of simple spiking cells to depolarizing

current steps superimposed on a steady-state membrane hyperpolarization

were studied. When the membrane has been held hyperpolarized, small

current pulses produce a long-latency regular train of action potentials.

Larger current pulses superimposed on membrane hyperpolarization

can produce a short-latency action potential followed by a long silent

interval (i.e., a long first interspike interval), and finally a

regular train of spikes. It is concluded that the membrane conductances

of DCN pyramidal cells are capable of generating at least 3 discharge

patterns (regular firing, long first spike latency, and long first

interspike interval) depending on the state of the membrane potential

prior to a depolarizing current step. These responses are similar

to the "chopper," "buildup," and "pauser" discharge patterns reported

abstract = {The gymnotiform weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus can capture prey using electrosensory cues that are dominated by low temporal frequencies. However, conventional tuning curves predict poor electroreceptor afferent responses to low-frequency stimuli. We compared conventional tuning curves with information tuning curves and found that the latter predicted substantially improved responses to these behaviorally relevant stimuli. Analysis of receptor afferent baseline activity showed that negative correlations reduced low-frequency noise levels, thereby increasing information transmission. Multiunit recordings from receptor afferents showed that this increased information transmission could persist at the population level. Finally, we verified that this increased low-frequency information is preserved in the spike trains of central neurons that receive receptor afferent input. Our results demonstrate that conventional tuning curves can be misleading when certain noise reduction strategies are used by the nervous system.},

abstract = {Although it is known that voltage-gated \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} conductances (VGCCs)

contribute to the responses of dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) neurons,

little is known about the properties of VGCCs in the DCN. In this

study, the whole cell voltage-clamp technique was used to examine

the pharmacology and voltage dependence of VGCCs in unidentified

DCN neurons acutely isolated from guinea pig brain stem. The majority

of cells responded to depolarization with sustained inward currents

that were enhanced when \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} was replaced by Ba2+, were blocked

partially by Ni2+ (100 microM), and were blocked almost completely

by Cd2+ (50 microM). Experiments using nifedipine (10 microM), omegaAga

IVA (100 nM) and omegaCTX GVIA (500 nM) demonstrated that a variety

of VGCC subtypes contributed to the Ba2+ current in most cells, including

the L, N, and P/Q types and antagonist-insensitive R type. Although

a large depolarization from rest was required to activate VGCCs in

DCN neurons, VGCC activation was rapid at depolarized levels, having

time constants <1 ms at 22 degrees C. No fast low-threshold inactivation

was observed, and a slow high-threshold inactivation was observed

at voltages more positive than -20 mV, indicating that Ba2+ currents

were carried by high-voltage activated VGCCs. The VGCC subtypes contributing

to the overall Ba2+ current had similar voltage-dependent properties,

with the exception of the antagonist-insensitive R-type component,

which had a slower activation and a more pronounced inactivation

than the other components. These data suggest that a variety of VGCCs

is present in DCN neurons, and these conductances generate a rapid

\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} influx in response to depolarizing stimuli.},

number of remarkable advantages, including explicit unitarity, a
physical Fock expansion, the absence of ghost degrees of freedom,
and the decoupling properties needed to prove factorization theorems
in high momentum transfer inclusive and exclusive reactions. We present
a systematic study of LF-quantized gauge theory following the Dirac
method and construct the Dyson-Wick S-matrix expansion based on LF-time-ordered
products. The free theory gauge field is shown to satisfy the Lorentz
condition as an operator equation as well as the light-cone gauge
condition. Its propagator is found to be transverse with respect
to both its four-momentum and the gauge direction. The interaction
Hamiltonian of QCD can be expressed in a form resembling that of
covariant theory, except for additional instantaneous interactions
which can be treated systematically. The renormalization constants
in YM theory are shown to satisfy the identity Z1 = Z3 at one loop
order. The QCD function computed in the noncovariant light-cone gauge
agrees with that known in the conventional framework. Some comments
on the relationship of our LF framework, with the doubly transverse
gauge propagator, to the analytic effective charge and renormalization
scheme defined by the pinch technique, the unitarity relations and
the spectral representation are also made. LF quantization thus provides
a consistent formulation of gauge theory, despite the fact that the

characteristic surfaces of a hyperbolic partial di erential equation.},

Physiological studies of these neurons have shown that sparseness is maintained across thousand-fold changes in odor concentration. Using a realistic computational model, we propose that sparseness in the olfactory system is regulated by adaptive feedforward inhibition. When odor concentration changes, feedforward inhibition modulates the duration of the temporal window over which the mushroom body neurons may integrate excitatory presynaptic input. This simple adaptive mechanism could maintain the sparseness of sensory representations across wide ranges of stimulus conditions.},

has been trapped inside intact mouse and pig lymphocytes, to measure

and manipulate cytoplasmic free \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} concentrations, [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i.

Quin2 is a tetracarboxylic acid which binds \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} with 1:1

stoichiometry and an effective dissociation constant of 115 nM in

a cationic background mimicking cytoplasm. Its fluorescence signal

(excitation 339 nm, emission 492 nm) increases about fivefold going

from Ca-free to CA-saturated forms. Cells are loaded with quin2 by

incubation with its acetoxymethyl ester, which readily permeates

the membrane and is hydrolyzed in the cytoplasm, thus trapping the

impermeant quin2 there. The intracellular quin2 appears to be free

in cytoplasm, not bound to membranes and not sequestered inside organelles.

The fluorescence signal from resting cells indicates a [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i

of near 120 nM. The millimolar loadings of quin2 needed for accurately

calibrated signals do not seem to perturb steady-state [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i,

but do somewhat slow or blunt [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i transients. Loadings

of up to 2mM are without serious toxic effects, though above this

level some lowering of cellular ATP is observed. [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i

was well stabilized in the face of large changes in external \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}.

Alterations of Na+ gradients, membrane potential, or intracellular

pH had little effect. Mitochondrial poisons produced a small increase

in [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i, probably due mostly to the effects of severe

ATP depletion on the plasma membrane. Thus intracellulary trapped

chelators like quin2 offer a method to measure or buffer [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}]\_i

in hitherto intractable cell types.},

the particles are crucial, and are described by a two-particle S-matrix
which has a super-universal form at low momenta. This is established
by computations on the O(3) \"{I}ƒ-model, and strong and weak coupling
expansions (the latter using a Majorana fermion representation) for
the two-leg S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder. As an aside,
we note that the strong-coupling calculation reveals a S = 1, two
particle bound state which leads to the presence of a second peak
in the T = 0 inelastic neutron scattering (INS) cross-section for
a range of values of momentum transfer. We obtain exact, or numerically
exact, universal expressions for the thermal broadening of the quasi-particle
peak in the INS cross-section, for the magnetization transport, and
for the field dependence of the NMR relaxation rate 1/T1 of the effective
semiclassical model: these are expected to be asymptotically exact
for the quantum antiferromagnets. The results for 1/T1 are compared
with the experimental findings of Takigawa et.al. and the agreement
is quite good. In the regime Delta < T < (a typical microscopic exchange)
we argue that a complementary description in terms of semiclassical

abstract = {1. We reexamine the possibilities for analyzing and interpreting the time course of correlation in spike trains simultaneously and separably recorded from two neurons. 2. We develop procedures to quantify and properly normalize the classical joint peristimulus time scatter diagram. These allow separation of the "raw" correlation into components caused by direct stimulus modulations of the single-neuron firing rates and those caused by various types of interaction between the two neurons. 3. A newly developed significance test ("surprise") is applied to evaluate such inferences. 4. Application of the new procedures to simulated spike trains allowed the recovery of the known circuitry. In particular, it proved possible to recover fast stimulus-locked modulations of "effective connectivity," even if they were masked by strong direct stimulus modulations of individual firing rates. These procedures thus present a clearly superior alternative to the commonly used "shift predictor." 5. Adopting a model-based approach, we generalize the classical measures for quantifying a direct interneuronal connection ("efficacy" and "contribution") to include possible stimulus-locked time variations. 6. Application of the new procedures to real spike trains from several different preparations showed that fast stimulus-locked modulations of "effective connectivity" also occur for real neurons.},

Topological and geometrical properties of these graphs can be measured and compared to random graphs and to graphs derived from other neuroscience data or other (nonneural) complex systems. Both structural and functional human brain graphs have consistently demonstrated key topological properties such as small-worldness, modularity, and heterogeneous degree distributions. Brain graphs are also physically embedded so as to nearly minimize wiring cost, a key geometric property.

IFPs express well in mammalian cells and mice and spontaneously incorporate biliverdin, which is ubiquitous as the initial intermediate in heme catabolism but has negligible fluorescence by itself. Because their wavelengths penetrate tissue well, IFPs are suitable for whole-body imaging. The IFPs developed here provide a scaffold for further engineering.},

Although p(r) is a fundamental parameter in defining synaptic efficacy, it is not uniform across all synapses, and the mechanisms by which a given synapse sets its basal release probability are unknown. By measuring p(r) at single presynaptic terminals in connected pairs of hippocampal neurons, we show that neighboring synapses on the same dendritic branch have very similar release probabilities, and p(r) is negatively correlated with the number of synapses on the branch. Increasing dendritic depolarization elicits a homeostatic decrease in p(r), and equalizing activity in the dendrite significantly reduces its variability. Our results indicate that local dendritic activity is the major determinant of basal release probability, and we suggest that this feedback regulation might be required to maintain synapses in their operational range.},

abstract = {We have developed a mathematical approach to the study of dynamical biological networks, based on combining large-scale numerical simulation with nonlinear "dimensionality reduction" methods. Our work was motivated by an interest in the complex organization of the signaling cascade centered on the neuronal phosphoprotein DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32,000). Our approach has allowed us to detect robust features of the system in the presence of noise. In particular, the global network topology serves to stabilize the net state of DARPP-32 phosphorylation in response to variation of the input levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate, despite significant perturbation to the concentrations and levels of activity of a number of intermediate chemical species. Further, our results suggest that the entire topology of the network is needed to impart this stability to one portion of the network at the expense of the rest. This could have significant implications for systems biology, in that large, complex pathways may have properties that are not easily replicated with simple modules.},

abstract = {A video-rate (30 frames/s) scanning two-photon excitation microscope has been successfully tested. The microscope, based on a Nikon RCM 8000, incorporates a femtosecond pulsed laser with wavelength tunable from 690 to 1050 nm, prechirper optics for laser pulse-width compression, resonant galvanometer for video-rate point scanning, and a pair of nonconfocal detectors for fast emission ratioing. An increase in fluorescent emission of 1.75-fold is consistently obtained with the use of the prechirper optics. The nonconfocal detectors provide another 2.25-fold increase in detection efficiency. Ratio imaging and optical sectioning can therefore be performed more efficiently without confocal optics. Faster frame rates, at 60, 120, and 240 frames/s, can be achieved with proportionally reduced scan lines per frame. Useful two-photon images can be acquired at video rate with a laser power as low as 2.7 mW at specimen with the genetically modified green fluorescent proteins. Preliminary results obtained using this system confirm that the yellow "cameleons" exhibit similar optical properties as under one-photon excitation conditions. Dynamic two-photon images of cardiac myocytes and ratio images of yellow cameleon-2.1, -3.1, and -3.1nu are also presented.},

abstract = {Uncertainty coming from the noise in its neurons and the ill-posed nature of many tasks plagues neural computations. Maybe surprisingly, many studies show that the brain manipulates these forms of uncertainty in a probabilistically consistent and normative manner, and there is now a rich theoretical literature on the capabilities of populations of neurons to implement computations in the face of uncertainty. However, one major facet of uncertainty has received comparatively little attention: time. In a dynamic, rapidly changing world, data are only temporarily relevant. Here, we analyze the computational consequences of encoding stimulus trajectories in populations of neurons. For the most obvious, simple, instantaneous encoder, the correlations induced by natural, smooth stimuli engender a decoder that requires access to information that is nonlocal both in time and across neurons. This formally amounts to a ruinous representation. We show that there is an alternative encoder that is computationally and representationally powerful in which each spike contributes independent information; it is independently decodable, in other words. We suggest this as an appropriate foundation for understanding time-varying population codes. Furthermore, we show how adaptation to temporal stimulus statistics emerges directly from the demands of simple decoding.},

During periods of rapid learning we observed a pronounced deterioration in song structure after night-sleep. The song regained structure after intense morning singing. Daily improvement in similarity to the tutored song occurred during the late phase of this morning recovery; little further improvement occurred thereafter. Furthermore, birds that showed stronger post-sleep deterioration during development achieved a better final imitation. The effect diminished with age. Our experiments showed that these oscillations were not a result of sleep inertia or lack of practice, indicating the possible involvement of an active process, perhaps neural song-replay during sleep. We suggest that these oscillations correspond to competing demands of plasticity and consolidation during learning, creating repeated opportunities to reshape previously learned motor skills.},

have been examined at many levels, from molecular to functional.

However, there has never been a direct and selective measurement

of excitatory synaptic function following total hearing loss. In

the present study, gerbils were deafened at postnatal day 9, an age

at which there is no deafferentation-induced cell death of ventral

cochlear nucleus neurons. One to five days after bilateral cochlear

ablation, the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents

(EPSC) was measured with whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in an

inferior colliculus (IC) brain slice preparation in response to electrical

stimulation of the ipsilateral lateral lemniscus (LL) or the commissure

of the inferior colliculus (CIC). Deafness resulted in larger LL-

and CIC-evoked EPSC amplitudes and durations. This result was observed

at a depolarized holding potential. In addition, deafness caused

a decrease in excitatory neurotransmitter release at the LL pathway,

as assessed with a paired-pulse stimulation protocol. In contrast

to its effect on excitatory synapses, bilateral cochlear ablation

reduced inhibitory synaptic strength in IC neurons. The effects included

a postsynaptic decrease in IPSC conductance, a 25-mV depolarization

in the IPSC equilibrium potential and a decrease of neurotransmitter

release. Thus normal innervation differentially affects excitatory

and inhibitory synaptic strength in IC neurons, and these changes

may contribute to alterations in auditory coding properties following

sensory deprivation.},

abstract = {Most currently available confocal or two-photon laser scanning microscopes (LSMs) allow acquisition rates of the order of 1-5 images s(-1), which is too slow to fully resolve dynamic changes in intracellular messenger concentration in living cells or tissues. Several technologies exist to obtain faster imaging rates, either in the video-rate range (30 images s(-1)) or beyond, but the most versatile technology available today is based on resonant scanners for horizontal line scanning. These scanning devices have several advantages over designs based on acousto-optical deflectors or Nipkow discs, but a drawback is that the scanning pattern is not a linear but rather a sinusoidal function of time. This puts additional constraints on the hardware necessary to read-in the image data flow, one of which is the generation of a pixel clock that varies in frequency with the position of the pixel on the scanned line. We describe a practical solution to obtain a variable pixel clock add-on that is easy to build and is easy to integrate into a custom-built LSM based on resonant scanning technology. In addition, we discuss some important hardware and software design aspects that simplify the construction of a resonant scanning-based LSM for high-speed, high-resolution imaging. Finally, we demonstrate that the microscope can be used to resolve calcium puffs triggered by photolytically increasing the intracellular concentration of inositol trisphosphate.},

abstract = {How different is local cortical circuitry from a random network? To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further.},

abstract = {Imaging technologies are well suited to study neuronal dendrites,

are, however, frequently oriented perpendicular to tissue surfaces,
impeding in vivo imaging approaches. Here we introduce novel laser-scanning
modes for two-photon microscopy that enable in vivo imaging of spatiotemporal
activity patterns in dendrites. First, we developed a method to image
planes arbitrarily oriented in 3D, which proved particularly beneficial
for calcium imaging of parallel fibers and Purkinje cell dendrites
in rat cerebellar cortex. Second, we applied free linescanseither
through multiple dendrites or along a single vertically oriented
dendriteto reveal fast dendritic calcium dynamics in neocortical
pyramidal neurons. Finally, we invented a ribbon-type 3D scanning
method for imaging user-defined convoluted planes enabling simultaneous
measurements of calcium signals along multiple apical dendrites.
These novel scanning modes will facilitate optical probing of dendritic

abstract = {Background: The electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects the electrical
activity in the brain on the surface of scalp. A major challenge
in this field is the localization of sources in the brain responsible
for eliciting the EEG signal measured at the scalp. In order to estimate
the location of these sources, one must correctly model the sources,
i.e., dipoles, as well as the volume conductor in which the resulting
currents flow. In this study, we investigate the effects of dipole
depth and orientation on source localization with varying sets of
simulated random noise in 4 realistic head models. Methods: Dipole
simulations were performed using realistic head models and using
the boundary element method (BEM). In all, 92 dipole locations placed
in temporal and parietal regions of the head with varying depth and
orientation were investigated along with 6 different levels of simulated
random noise. Localization errors due to dipole depth, orientation
and noise were investigated. Results: The results indicate that there
are no significant differences in localization error due tangential
and radial dipoles. With high levels of simulated Gaussian noise,
localization errors are depth-dependant. For low levels of added
noise, errors are similar for both deep and superficial sources.
Conclusion: It was found that if the signal-to-noise ratio is above
a certain threshold, localization errors in realistic head models
are, on average the same for deep and superficial sources. As the
noise increases, localization errors increase, particularly for deep
sources.},

We devised a method called "affinity propagation," which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

abstract = {There is much current interest in identifying the anatomical and functional circuits that are the basis of the brain's computations, with hope that functional neuroimaging techniques will allow the in vivo study of these neural processes through the statistical analysis of the time-series they produce. Ideally, the use of techniques such as multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modelling should allow the identification of effective connectivity by combining graphical modelling methods with the concept of Granger causality. Unfortunately, current time-series methods perform well only for the case that the length of the time-series Nt is much larger than p, the number of brain sites studied, which is exactly the reverse of the situation in neuroimaging for which relatively short time-series are measured over thousands of voxels. Methods are introduced for dealing with this situation by using sparse MAR models. These can be estimated in a two-stage process involving (i) penalized regression and (ii) pruning of unlikely connections by means of the local false discovery rate developed by Efron. Extensive simulations were performed with idealized cortical networks having small world topologies and stable dynamics. These show that the detection efficiency of connections of the proposed procedure is quite high. Application of the method to real data was illustrated by the identification of neural circuitry related to emotional processing as measured by BOLD.},

abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

Second harmonic imaging (SHIM) is an ideal method for probing membranes of living cells because it offers the high resolution of nonlinear optical microscopy with the potential for near-total avoidance of photobleaching and phototoxicity. The technique has been implemented on three cell lines labeled with membrane-staining dyes that have large nonlinear optical coefficients. The images can be obtained within physiologically relevant time scales. Both achiral and chiral dyes were used to compare image formation for the case of single- and double-leaflet staining, and it was found that chirality plays a significant role in the mechanism of contrast generation. It is also shown that SHIM is highly sensitive to membrane potential, with a depolarization of 25 mV resulting in an approximately twofold loss of signal intensity.},

abstract = {Many parameters driving the behavior of biochemical circuits vary extensively and are thus not fine-tuned. Therefore, the topology of such circuits (the who-interacts-with-whom) is key to understanding their central properties. I here explore several hundred different topologies of a simple biochemical model of circadian oscillations to ask two questions: Do different circuits differ dramatically in their robustness to parameter change? If so, can a process of gradual molecular evolution find highly robust topologies when starting from less robust topologies? I find that the distribution of robustness among different circuit topologies is highly skewed: Most show low robustness, whereas very few topologies are highly robust. To address the second evolutionary question, I define a topology graph, each of whose nodes corresponds to one circuit topology that shows circadian oscillations. Two nodes in this graph are connected if they differ by only one regulatory interaction within the circuit. For the circadian oscillator I study, most topologies are connected in this graph, making evolutionary transitions from low to high robustness easy. A similar approach has been used to study the evolution of robustness in biological macromolecules, with similar results. This suggests that the same principles govern the evolution of robustness on different levels of biological organization. The regulatory interlocking of several oscillating gene products in biological circadian oscillators may exist because it provides robustness.},

abstract = {Complex functional brain networks are large networks of brain regions and functional brain connections. Statistical characterizations of these networks aim to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small number of network measures. Important functional network measures include measures of modularity (measures of the goodness with which a network is optimally partitioned into functional subgroups) and measures of centrality (measures of the functional influence of individual brain regions). Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity, but are associated with several important methodological problems. These problems include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity partitions of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for testing hypotheses of association between observed nontrivial network properties and simple weighted connectivity properties. In this study we describe a set of methods to overcome these problems. Specifically, we generalize measures of modularity and centrality to fully connected and weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate high-modularity partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity null model of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary measures of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) networks from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access repository of resting-state functional MRI datasets. Our methods may allow more sound and reliable characterizations and comparisons of functional brain networks across conditions and subjects.},

We also show that, contrary to current opinion, the dynamics of a network composed of such neurons has two stable fixed points, even in the purely excitatory network, corresponding to two different states of reverberating activity. The analytical results are compared with numerical simulations and are found to be in good agreement.},

@article{Tiesinga2005,
abstract = {Recordings from area V4 of monkeys have revealed that when the focus
of attention is on a visual stimulus within the receptive field of
a cortical neuron, two distinct changes can occur: The firing rate
of the neuron can change and there can be an increase in the coherence
between spikes and the local field potential (LFP) in the gamma-frequency
range (30\^{A}–50 Hz). The hypothesis explored here is that these observed
effects of attention could be a consequence of changes in the synchrony
of local interneuron networks. We performed computer simulations
of a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron driven by a constant depolarizing
current, I, representing visual stimulation and a modulatory inhibitory
input representing the effects of attention via local interneuron
networks. We observed that the neuron's firing rate and the coherence
of its output spike train with the synaptic inputs was modulated
by the degree of synchrony of the inhibitory inputs. When inhibitory
synchrony increased, the coherence of spiking model neurons with
the synaptic input increased, but the firing rate either increased
or remained the same. The mean number of synchronous inhibitory inputs
was a key determinant of the shape of the firing rate versus current
(f\^{A}–I) curves. For a large number of inhibitory inputs (50), the
f\^{A}–I curve saturated for large I and an increase in input synchrony
resulted in a shift of sensitivity\^{A}—the model neuron responded to
weaker inputs I. For a small number (10), the f\^{A}–I curves were non-saturating
and an increase in input synchrony led to an increase in the gain
of the response\^{A}—the firing rate in response to the same input was
multiplied by an approximately constant factor. The firing rate modulation
with inhibitory synchrony was highest when the input network oscillated
in the gamma frequency range. Thus, the observed changes in firing
rate and coherence of neurons in the visual cortex could be controlled
by top-down inputs that regulated the coherence in the activity of
a local inhibitory network discharging at gamma frequencies.},

abstract = {Neuroscience produces a vast amount of data from an enormous diversity of neurons. A neuronal classification system is essential to organize such data and the knowledge that is derived from them. Classification depends on the unequivocal identification of the features that distinguish one type of neuron from another. The problems inherent in this are particularly acute when studying cortical interneurons. To tackle this, we convened a representative group of researchers to agree on a set of terms to describe the anatomical, physiological and molecular features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex. The resulting terminology might provide a stepping stone towards a future classification of these complex and heterogeneous cells. Consistent adoption will be important for the success of such an initiative, and we also encourage the active involvement of the broader scientific community in the dynamic evolution of this project.},

Most recording studies in the motor cortex, however, have investigated the encoding of time-independent features of movement such as direction, velocity, position, or force. Here, we show that single motor cortical neurons encode temporally evolving movement trajectories and not simply instantaneous movement parameters. We explicitly characterize the preferred trajectories of individual neurons using a simple exponential encoding model and demonstrate that temporally extended trajectories not only capture the tuning of motor cortical neurons more accurately, but can be used to decode the instantaneous movement direction with less error. These findings suggest that single motor cortical neurons encode whole movement fragments, which are temporally extensive and can be quite complex.},

Here we show the effects of night-sleep on song development in the zebra finch by recording and analysing the entire song ontogeny. During periods of rapid learning we observed a pronounced deterioration in song structure after night-sleep. The song regained structure after intense morning singing. Daily improvement in similarity to the tutored song occurred during the late phase of this morning recovery; little further improvement occurred thereafter. Furthermore, birds that showed stronger post-sleep deterioration during development achieved a better final imitation. The effect diminished with age. Our experiments showed that these oscillations were not a result of sleep inertia or lack of practice, indicating the possible involvement of an active process, perhaps neural song-replay during sleep. We suggest that these oscillations correspond to competing demands of plasticity and consolidation during learning, creating repeated opportunities to reshape previously learned motor skills.},

abstract = {Cochlear damage can change the spontaneous firing rates of neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Increased spontaneous firing rates (hyperactivity) after acoustic trauma have been observed in the DCN of rodents such as hamsters, chinchillas and rats. This hyperactivity has been interpreted as a neural correlate of tinnitus. In cats, however, the spontaneous firing rates of DCN neurons were not significantly elevated after acoustic trauma. Species-specific spontaneous firing rates after cochlear damage might be attributable to differences in the response types of DCN neurons: In gerbils, type III response characteristics are predominant, whereas in cats type IV responses are more frequent. To address the question of how the development of hyperactivity after cochlear damage depends on the response type of DCN neurons, we use a computational model of the basic circuit of the DCN. By changing the strength of two types of inhibition, we can reproduce salient features of the responses of DCN neurons. Simulated cochlear damage, which decreases the activity of auditory nerve fibers, is assumed to activate homeostatic plasticity in projection neurons (PNs) of the DCN. We find that the resulting spontaneous firing rates depend on the response type of DCN PNs: PNs with type III and type IV-T response characteristics may become hyperactive, whereas type IV PNs do not develop increased spontaneous firing rates after acoustic trauma. This theoretical framework for the mechanisms and circumstances of the development of hyperactivity in central auditory neurons might also provide new insights into the development of tinnitus.},

The stimulus-feature preferences of astrocytes were exquisitely mapped across the cortical surface, in close register with neuronal maps. The spatially restricted stimulus-specific component of the intrinsic hemodynamic mapping signal was highly sensitive to astrocyte activation, indicating that astrocytes have a key role in coupling neuronal organization to mapping signals critical for noninvasive brain imaging. Furthermore, blocking astrocyte glutamate transporters influenced the magnitude and duration of adjacent visually driven neuronal responses.},

Particle filtering is a technique used for filtering nonlinear dynamical systems driven by non-Gaussian noise processes. It has found widespread applications in detection, navigation, and tracking problems. Although, in general, particle filtering methods yield improved results, it is difficult to achieve real time performance. In this paper, we analyze the computational drawbacks of traditional particle filtering algorithms, and present a method for implementing the particle filter using the Independent Metropolis Hastings sampler, that is highly amenable to pipelined implementations and parallelization. We analyze the implementations of the proposed algorithm, and, in particular, concentrate on implementations that have minimum processing times. It is shown that the design parameters for the fastest implementation can be chosen by solving a set of convex programs. The proposed computational methodology was verified using a cluster of PCs for the application of visual tracking. We demonstrate a linear speed-up of the algorithm using the methodology proposed in the paper.},

abstract = {Randomness is a fundamental feature of nature and a valuable resource for applications ranging from cryptography and gambling to numerical simulation of physical and biological systems. Random numbers, however, are difficult to characterize mathematically, and their generation must rely on an unpredictable physical process. Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes or failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control and detect. Here, inspired by earlier work on non-locality-based and device-independent quantum information processing, we show that the non-local correlations of entangled quantum particles can be used to certify the presence of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design a cryptographically secure random number generator that does not require any assumption about the internal working of the device. Such a strong form of randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems only if certified by a Bell inequality violation. We carry out a proof-of-concept demonstration of this proposal in a system of two entangled atoms separated by approximately one metre. The observed Bell inequality violation, featuring near perfect detection efficiency, guarantees that 42 new random numbers are generated with 99 per cent confidence. Our results lay the groundwork for future device-independent quantum information experiments and for addressing fundamental issues raised by the intrinsic randomness of quantum theory.},

abstract = {Although the nonlinear optical effect known as second-harmonic generation (SHG) has been recognized since the earliest days of laser physics and was demonstrated through a microscope over 25 years ago, only in the past few years has it begun to emerge as a viable microscope imaging contrast mechanism for visualization of cell and tissue structure and function. Only small modifications are required to equip a standard laser-scanning two-photon microscope for second-harmonic imaging microscopy (SHIM). Recent studies of the three-dimensional in vivo structures of well-ordered protein assemblies, such as collagen, microtubules and muscle myosin, are beginning to establish SHIM as a nondestructive imaging modality that holds promise for both basic research and clinical pathology. Thus far the best signals have been obtained in a transmitted light geometry that precludes in vivo measurements on large living animals. This drawback may be addressed through improvements in the collection of SHG signals via an epi-illumination microscope configuration. In addition, SHG signals from certain membrane-bound dyes have been shown to be highly sensitive to membrane potential. Although this indicates that SHIM may become a valuable tool for probing cell physiology, the small signal size would limit the number of photons that could be collected during the course of a fast action potential. Better dyes and optimized microscope optics could ultimately lead to the imaging of neuronal electrical activity with SHIM.},

type that generates complex action potentials, based on their analogous

anatomical, developmental, and biochemical similarities to cerebellar

Purkinje cells, which are known to discharge complex action potentials.

Intracellular recordings were made from a brain slice preparation

of the guinea pig dorsal cochlear nucleus. A subpopulation of cells

discharged a series of two or three action potentials riding on a

slow depolarization as an all-or-none event; this discharge pattern

is called a complex spike or burst. These cells also exhibited anodal

break bursts, anomalous rectification, subthreshold inward rectification,

and frequent inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). Seven complex-spiking

cells were stained with intracellular dyes and subsequently identified

as cartwheel neurons. In contrast, six identified simple-spiking

cells recorded in concurrent experiments were pyramidal cells. The

cartwheel cell bodies reside in the lower part of layer 1 and the

upper part of layer 2 of the nucleus. The cells are characterized

by spiny dendrites penetrating the molecular layer, a lack of basal

dendritic processes, and an axonal plexus invading layers 2 and 3,

and the inner regions of layer 1. The cartwheel cell axons made putative

synaptic contacts at the light microscopic level with pyramidal cells

and small cells, including stellate cells, granule cells, and other

cartwheel cells in layers 1 and 2. The axonal plexus of individual

cartwheel cells suggests that they can inhibit cells receiving input

from either the same or adjacent parallel fibers and that this inhibition

is distributed along the isofrequency contours of the nucleus.},

This process has been conceptualized as system-level consolidation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed over the course of three months how consolidation affects the neural correlates of memory retrieval. The duration of slow-wave sleep during a nap/rest period after the initial study session and before the first scan session on day 1 correlated positively with recognition memory performance for items studied before the nap and negatively with hippocampal activity associated with correct confident recognition. Over the course of the entire study, hippocampal activity for correct confident recognition continued to decrease, whereas activity in a ventral medial prefrontal region increased. These findings, together with data obtained in rodents, may prompt a revision of classical consolidation theory, incorporating a transfer of putative linking nodes from hippocampal to prelimbic prefrontal areas.},

abstract = {Computational models of neural map formation can be considered on at least three different levels of abstraction: detailed models including neural activity dynamics, weight dynamics that abstract from the neural activity dynamics by an adiabatic approximation, and constrained optimization from which equations governing weight dynamics can be derived. Constrained optimization uses an objective function, from which a weight growth rule can be derived as a gradient flow, and some constraints, from which normalization rules are derived. In this article, we present an example of how an optimization problem can be derived from detailed nonlinear neural dynamics. A systematic investigation reveals how different weight dynamics introduced previously can be derived from two types of objective function terms and two types of constraints. This includes dynamic link matching as a special case of neural map formation. We focus in particular on the role of coordinate transformations to derive different weight dynamics from the same optimization problem. Several examples illustrate how the constrained optimization framework can help in understanding, generating, and comparing different models of neural map formation. The techniques used in this analysis may also be useful in investigating other types of neural dynamics.},

The U-box is a recently identified, ubiquitin ligase activity-related protein domain that shows greater presence in plants than in other organisms. In this study, we identified 77 putative U-box proteins from the rice genome using a battery of whole genome analysis algorithms. Most of the U-box protein genes are expressed, as supported by the identification of their corresponding expressed sequence tags (ESTs), full-length cDNAs, or massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) tags. Using the same algorithms, we identified 61 U-box proteins from the Arabidopsis genome. The rice and Arabidopsis U-box proteins were classified into nine major classes based on their domain compositions. Comparison between rice and Arabidopsis U-box proteins indicates that the majority of rice and Arabidopsis U-box proteins have the same domain organizations. The inferred phylogeny established the homology between rice and Arabidopsis U-box/ARM proteins. Cell death assay using the rice protoplast system suggests that one rice U-box gene, OsPUB51, might act as a negative regulator of cell death signaling. In addition, the selected U-box proteins were found to be functional E3 ubiquitin ligases. The identification and analysis of rice U-box proteins hereby at the genomic level will help functionally characterize this class of E3 ubiquitin ligase in the future.},

abstract = {Neurons in high-level sensory cortical areas respond to complex features in sensory stimuli. Feature elimination is a useful technique for studying these responses. In this approach, a complex stimulus, which evokes a neuronal response, is simplified, and if the cell responds to the reduced stimulus, it is considered selective for the remaining features. We have developed a feature-elimination technique that uses either the principal or the independent components of a stimulus to define a subset of features, to which a neuron might be sensitive. The original stimulus can be filtered using these components, resulting in a stimulus that retains only a fraction of the features present in the original. We demonstrate the use of this technique on macaque vocalizations, an important class of stimuli being used to study auditory function in awake, behaving primate experiments. We show that principal-component analysis extracts features that are closely related to the dominant Fourier components of the stimuli, often called formants in the study of speech perception. Conversely, independent-component analysis extracts features that preserve the relative phase across a set of harmonically related frequencies. We have used several statistical techniques to explore the original and filtered stimuli, as well as the components extracted by each technique. This novel approach provides a powerful method for determining the essential features within complex stimuli that activate higher-order sensory neurons.},

A variety of segmentation algorithms have been developed for this purpose. For confocal microscopy images, the noise introduced during the specimen preparation process, such as the procedure of penetration or staining, may cause images to be of low contrast in some regions. This property will make segmentation difficult. Also, the segmented structures may have rugged surfaces in 3D visualization. In this paper, we present a hybrid method that is suitable for segmentation of confocal microscopy images. A rough segmentation result is obtained from the atlas-based segmentation via affine registration. The boundaries of the segmentation result are close to the object boundaries, and are regarded as the initial contours of the active contour models. After convergence of the snake algorithm, the resulting contours in regions of low contrast are locally refined by parametric bicubic surfaces to alleviate the problem of incorrect convergence. The proposed method increases the accuracy of the snake algorithm because of better initial contours. Besides, it can provide smoother segmented results in 3D visualization.},

abstract = {Surface electromyography is used in research, to estimate the activity

of muscle, in prosthetic design, to provide a control signal, and

in biofeedback, to provide subjects with a visual or auditory indication

of muscle contraction. Unfortunately, successful applications are

limited by the variability in the signal and the consequent poor

quality of estimates. I propose to use a nonlinear recursive filter

based on Bayesian estimation. The desired filtered signal is modeled

as a combined diffusion and jump process and the measured electromyographic

(EMG) signal is modeled as a random process with a density in the

exponential family and rate given by the desired signal. The rate

is estimated on-line by calculating the full conditional density

given all past measurements from a single electrode. The Bayesian

estimate gives the filtered signal that best describes the observed

EMG signal. This estimate yields results with very low short-time

variability but also with the capability of very rapid response to

change. The estimate approximates isometric joint torque with lower

error and higher signal-to-noise ratio than current linear methods.

Use of the nonlinear filter significantly reduces noise compared

with current algorithms, and it may therefore permit more effective

use of the EMG signal for prosthetic control, biofeedback, and neurophysiology

research.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed a general description of parameter combinations for which specified characteristics of neuronal or network activity are constant. Our approach is based on the implicit function theorem and is applicable to activity characteristics that smoothly depend on parameters. Such smoothness is often intrinsic to neuronal systems when they are in stable functional states. The conclusions about how parameters compensate each other, developed in this study, can thus be used even without regard to the specific mathematical model describing a particular neuron or neuronal network. We showed that near a generic point in the parameter space there are infinitely many other points, or parameter combinations, for which specified characteristics of activity are the same as in the original point. These parameter combinations form a smooth manifold. This manifold can be extended as long as the gradients of characteristics are defined and independent. All possible variations of parameters compensating each other are simply all possible charts of the same manifold. The number of compensating parameters (but not parameters themselves) is fixed and equal to the number of the independent characteristics maintained. The algorithm that we developed shows how to find compensatory functional dependencies between parameters numerically. Our method can be used in the analysis of the homeostatic regulation, neuronal database search, model tuning and other applications.},

abstract = {Many theories of neural networks assume rules of connection between pairs of neurons that are based on their cell types or functional properties. It is finally becoming feasible to test such pairwise models of connectivity, due to emerging advances in neuroanatomical techniques. One method will be to measure the functional properties of connected pairs of neurons, sparsely sampling pairs from many specimens. Another method will be to find a "connectome," a dense map of all connections in a single specimen, and infer functional properties of neurons through computational analysis. For the latter method, the most exciting prospect would be to decode the memories that are hypothesized to be stored in connectomes.},

abstract = {Neurons are often assumed to operate in a highly unreliable manner: a neuron can signal the same stimulus with a variable number of action potentials. However, much of the experimental evidence supporting this view was obtained in the visual cortex. We have, therefore, assessed trial-to-trial variability in the auditory cortex of the rat. To ensure single-unit isolation, we used cell-attached recording. Tone-evoked responses were usually transient, often consisting of, on average, only a single spike per stimulus. Surprisingly, the majority of responses were not just transient, but were also binary, consisting of 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to each stimulus; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100\% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. The variability of such binary responses differs from comparably transient responses recorded in visual cortical areas such as area MT, and represent the lowest trial-to-trial variability mathematically possible for responses of a given firing rate. Our study thus establishes for the first time that transient responses in auditory cortex can be described as a binary process, rather than as a highly variable Poisson process. These results demonstrate that cortical architecture can support a more precise control of spike number than was previously recognized, and they suggest a re-evaluation of models of cortical processing that assume noisiness to be an inevitable feature of cortical codes.},

How these distributed responses are read out by subsequent processing stages to mediate behavior remains unknown. Here we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to measure directly population responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing a demanding visual detection task. We then evaluated the ability of different decoding rules to detect the target from the measured neural responses. We found that small visual targets elicit widespread responses in V1, and that response variability at distant sites is highly correlated. These correlations render most previously proposed decoding rules inefficient relative to one that uses spatially antagonistic center-surround summation. This optimal decoder consistently outperformed the monkey in the detection task, demonstrating the sensitivity of our techniques. Overall, our results suggest an unexpected role for inhibitory mechanisms in efficient decoding of neural population responses.},

The resulting regions of interest are used to define subset of fibers that are subdivided further into consistent bundles using a clustering of the fiber extremities. The dataset is reduced from more than one million fiber tracts to about two thousand fiber bundles. Validations are provided using simulated data and a physical phantom. We see our approach as a crucial preprocessing step before further analysis of huge fiber datasets. An important application will be the inference of detailed models of the subdivisions of white matter pathways and the mapping of the main U-fiber bundles.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper for four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) is threefold. (1) A new spatiotemporal model is presented from the matrix perspective with the row dimension in space and the column dimension in time, namely the robust PCA (principal component analysis)-based 4D CT model. That is, instead of viewing the 4D object as a temporal collection of three-dimensional (3D) images and looking for local coherence in time or space independently, we perceive it as a mixture of low-rank matrix and sparse matrix to explore the maximum temporal coherence of the spatial structure among phases. Here the low-rank matrix corresponds to the 'background' or reference state, which is stationary over time or similar in structure; the sparse matrix stands for the 'motion' or time-varying component, e.g., heart motion in cardiac imaging, which is often either approximately sparse itself or can be sparsified in the proper basis. Besides 4D CT, this robust PCA-based 4D CT model should be applicable in other imaging problems for motion reduction or/and change detection with the least amount of data, such as multi-energy CT, cardiac MRI, and hyperspectral imaging. (2) A dynamic strategy for data acquisition, i.e. a temporally spiral scheme, is proposed that can potentially maintain similar reconstruction accuracy with far fewer projections of the data. The key point of this dynamic scheme is to reduce the total number of measurements, and hence the radiation dose, by acquiring complementary data in different phases while reducing redundant measurements of the common background structure. (3) An accurate, efficient, yet simple-to-implement algorithm based on the split Bregman method is developed for solving the model problem with sparse representation in tight frames.},

Dark Matter particles are assumed to have a large cross-section for

cases where dark matter is treated as collisionless or as a fluid.
For the collisionless case the overall ellipticity of the cluster,
the central density cusp and the amount of surviving substructure
are all similar to those found in earlier high resolution simulations.
Collisional dark matter results in a cluster which is more nearly
spherical at all radii, has a steeper central density cusp, and has
less, but still substantial surviving substructure. As in the colisionless
case, these results for a \"{\i}¾“fluid\"{\i}¾” cluster halo are expected to
carry over approximately to smaller mass systems. The observed rotation
curves of dwarf galaxies then argue that self-interacting dark matter

the strong-coupling expansion of a d-dimensional quantum field theory,
starting from its Euclidean path-integral representation. At intermediate
stages we are required to evaluate diagrams on a lattice; the lattice
spacing provides a cutoff for the theory. We formulate a simple Pade-type
prescription for extrapolating to zero lattice spacing and thereby
obtain a series of approximants to the true strong-coupling expansion
of the theory. No infinite quantitites appear at any stage of the
calculation. Moreover, all diagrams are simple to evaluate (unlike
the diagrams of the ordinary weak-coupling expansion) because nothing
more than algebra is required, and no diagram, no matter how complex,
generates any transcendental quantities. We explain our approach
in the context of a g phi\^{}4 field theory and calculate the two-point
and four-point Green's functions. Then we specialize to d=1 (the
anharmonic oscillator) and compare the locations of the poles of
the Green's functions with the tabulated numerical values of the
energy levels. The agreement is excellent. Finally, we discuss the
application of these techniques to other models such as g phi\^{}2N,
g (bar psi psi) \^{}2 and quantum electrodynamics.},

abstract = {A tool or probe often functions as an extension of the hand, transmitting vibrations to the hand to produce a percept of the object contacting the tool or probe. This paper reports the psychophysical results of a combined psychophysical and neurophysiological study of the perception of vibration transmitted through a cylinder grasped in the hand. In the first part of the psychophysical study, 19 subjects grasped a cylinder, 32 mm diam, with an embedded motor that caused vibration parallel to the axis of the cylinder. The relationship between threshold and frequency was the traditional U-shaped function with a minimum between 150 and 200 Hz. Except a study by B\'{e}k\'{e}sy in which subjects grasped a rod that vibrated parallel to the skin surface, thresholds above 20 Hz were lower and the slopes were steeper than any reported previously. Thresholds were <0.01 microm in some subjects. Data from both the psychophysical and the neurophysiological studies suggest that detection performance at frequencies >20 Hz was based on activity in Pacinian afferents. The extreme sensitivity compared with previous reports may have resulted from differences in contact area, direction of vibration, contact force, and the shape of the stimulus probe. The effects of each of these variables were studied. At 40 and 300 Hz (frequencies near the lower and upper end of the Pacinian range) thresholds were 9.8 and 18.5 dB (68 and 88\%) lower, respectively, when subjects grasped the cylinder than when a 1-mm-diam probe vibrated perpendicular to the skin. These differences were accounted for as follows: 1) thresholds at a single fingerpad obtained with the large cylindrical surface were, on average, 20 and 60\% lower, respectively, than thresholds with the punctate probe; 2) thresholds at the palm were, on average, 15 and 40\% lower, respectively, than at the fingerpads; 3) thresholds obtained when the subjects grasped the cylinder averaged 40 and 20\% less, respectively, than when the cylinder contacted only the palm; 4) thresholds with the cylinder contacting two fingers were 10 and 30\% lower, respectively, than thresholds with the cylinder contacting a single finger; and 5) thresholds with vibration parallel to the skin surface were, on average, 10 and 30\% lower, respectively, than thresholds with vibration perpendicular to the skin. Contact force, which was varied from 0.05 to 1.0 N, had no effect.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal behavior is governed by the activity of interconnected brain circuits. Comprehensive brain wiring maps are thus needed in order to formulate hypotheses about information flow and also to guide genetic manipulations aimed at understanding how genes and circuits orchestrate complex behaviors. RESULTS: To assemble this map, we deconstructed the adult Drosophila brain into approximately 16,000 single neurons and reconstructed them into a common standardized framework to produce a virtual fly brain. We have constructed a mesoscopic map and found that it consists of 41 local processing units (LPUs), six hubs, and 58 tracts covering the whole Drosophila brain. Despite individual local variation, the architecture of the Drosophila brain shows invariance for both the aggregation of local neurons (LNs) within specific LPUs and for the connectivity of projection neurons (PNs) between the same set of LPUs. An open-access image database, named FlyCircuit, has been constructed for online data archiving, mining, analysis, and three-dimensional visualization of all single neurons, brain-wide LPUs, their wiring diagrams, and neural tracts. CONCLUSION: We found that the Drosophila brain is assembled from families of multiple LPUs and their interconnections. This provides an essential first step in the analysis of information processing within and between neurons in a complete brain.},

abstract = {A key step toward understanding the function of a brain circuit is to find its wiring diagram. New methods for optical stimulation and optical recording of neurons make it possible to map circuit connectivity on a very large scale. However, single synapses produce small responses that are difficult to measure on a large scale. Here I analyze how single synaptic responses may be detectable using relatively coarse readouts such as optical recording of somatic calcium. I model a network consisting of 10,000 input axons and 100 CA1 pyramidal neurons, each represented using 19 compartments with voltage-gated channels and calcium dynamics. As single synaptic inputs cannot produce a measurable somatic calcium response, I stimulate many inputs as a baseline to elicit somatic action potentials leading to a strong calcium signal. I compare statistics of responses with or without a single axonal input riding on this baseline. Through simulations I show that a single additional input shifts the distribution of the number of output action potentials. Stochastic resonance due to probabilistic synaptic release makes this shift easier to detect. With approximately 80 stimulus repetitions this approach can resolve up to 35\% of individual activated synapses even in the presence of 20\% recording noise. While the technique is applicable using conventional electrical stimulation and extracellular recording, optical methods promise much greater scaling, since the number of synapses scales as the product of the number of inputs and outputs. I extrapolate from current high-speed optical stimulation and recording methods, and show that this approach may scale up to the order of a million synapses in a single two-hour slice-recording experiment.},

based on green fluorescent protein variants and calmodulin (CaM).

Because cameleons can be targeted genetically and imaged by one-

or two-photon excitation microscopy, they offer great promise for

monitoring \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} in whole organisms, tissues, organelles, and

submicroscopic environments in which measurements were previously

impossible. However, the original cameleons suffered from significant

pH interference, and their \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}-buffering and cross-reactivity

with endogenous CaM signaling pathways was uncharacterized. We have

now greatly reduced the pH-sensitivity of the cameleons by introducing

mutations V68L and Q69K into the acceptor yellow green fluorescent

protein. The resulting new cameleons permit \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} measurements

despite significant cytosolic acidification. When \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} is

elevated, the CaM and CaM-binding peptide fused together in a cameleon

abstract = {Brain graphs provide a relatively simple and increasingly popular way of modeling the human brain connectome, using graph theory to abstractly define a nervous system as a set of nodes (denoting anatomical regions or recording electrodes) and interconnecting edges (denoting structural or functional connections). Topological and geometrical properties of these graphs can be measured and compared to random graphs and to graphs derived from other neuroscience data or other (nonneural) complex systems. Both structural and functional human brain graphs have consistently demonstrated key topological properties such as small-worldness, modularity, and heterogeneous degree distributions. Brain graphs are also physically embedded so as to nearly minimize wiring cost, a key geometric property. Here we offer a conceptual review and methodological guide to graphical analysis of human neuroimaging data, with an emphasis on some of the key assumptions, issues, and trade-offs facing the investigator.

that unilateral deafening causes a reduction in inhibition in the

adult gerbil inferior colliculus (IC) contralateral to the deafened

ear. Multiple-unit recordings were made from single electrode penetrations

in the IC prior to and directly after contralateral cochlear ablation.

These recordings showed up to 60\% increases in the proportion of

sampled loci at which neural activity excited by ipsilateral stimulation

was observed after the ablation. Novel excitatory responses were

evident within minutes of the ablation. Western blotting for glutamic

acid decarboxylase protein levels showed significant decreases in

the IC contralateral to cochlear ablation, relative to those in the

ipsilateral IC, at 24 h and 7 days survival after the ablation. Four

hour or 1 year survival post-ablation did not produce significant

contralateral/ipsilateral differences in relation to the control

group. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of at least

two, short-term mechanisms involved in the central response to cochlear

removal, both of which appear to implicate a decreased inhibitory

influence. One is a very rapid, stimulus-related, functional unmasking.

The other is a more delayed reduction in the capacity of gamma-aminobutyric

acid synthesis in the IC.},

@article{Horton2005,
abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary
of Mountcastle\"{\i}¾’s discovery of the cortical column. In this review,we
summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing
realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it
was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the
somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single
modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently,
examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas,
expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different
structures and principles. A \"{\i}¾‘column\"{\i}¾’ now refers to cells in
any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive
field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same
eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably,
ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others.
In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by
searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate
with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has
been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require
ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that
the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable
among members of the same species, or even in different portions
of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal
a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose.
More broadly, the term \"{\i}¾‘column\"{\i}¾’ also denotes the periodic termination
of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many
instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with
some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches
in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide
cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing
streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed
by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive
concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding
cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex
will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections
and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various
areas.},

abstract = {Synaptic plasticity was recently shown to depend on the relative timing of the pre- and postsynaptic spikes. This article analytically derives a spike-dependent learning rule based on the principle of information maximization for a single neuron with spiking inputs. This rule is then transformed into a biologically feasible rule, which is compared to the experimentally observed plasticity. This comparison reveals that the biological rule increases information to a near-optimal level and provides insights into the structure of biological plasticity. It shows that the time dependency of synaptic potentiation should be determined by the synaptic transfer function and membrane leak. Potentiation consists of weight-dependent and weight-independent components whose weights are of the same order of magnitude. It further suggests that synaptic depression should be triggered by rare and relevant inputs but at the same time serves to unlearn the baseline statistics of the network's inputs. The optimal depression curve is uniformly extended in time, but biological constraints that cause the cell to forget past events may lead to a different shape, which is not specified by our current model. The structure of the optimal rule thus suggests a computational account for several temporal characteristics of the biological spike-timing-dependent rules.},

abstract = {White matter microstructure is under strong genetic control, yet it is largely unknown how genetic influences change from childhood into adulthood. In one of the largest brain mapping studies ever performed, we determined whether the genetic control over white matter architecture depends on age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and intelligence quotient (IQ). We assessed white matter integrity voxelwise using diffusion tensor imaging at high magnetic field (4-Tesla), in 705 twins and their siblings (age range 12-29; 290M/415F). White matter integrity was quantified using a widely accepted measure, fractional anisotropy (FA). We fitted gene-environment interaction models pointwise, to visualize brain regions where age, sex, SES and IQ modulate heritability of fiber integrity. We hypothesized that environmental factors would start to outweigh genetic factors during late childhood and adolescence. Genetic influences were greater in adolescence versus adulthood, and greater in males than in females. Socioeconomic status significantly interacted with genes that affect fiber integrity: heritability was higher in those with higher SES. In people with above-average IQ, genetic factors explained over 80\% of the observed FA variability in the thalamus, genu, posterior internal capsule, and superior corona radiata. In those with below-average IQ, however, only around 40\% FA variability in the same regions was attributable to genetic factors. Genes affect fiber integrity, but their effects vary with age, sex, SES and IQ. Gene-environment interactions are vital to consider in the search for specific genetic polymorphisms that affect brain integrity and connectivity.},

Low intensity, long duration laser irradiation produces a sustained depolarization, insensitive to sodium channel blockers yet sensitive to antioxidants. On the other hand, high intensity, short duration irradiation can induce fast depolarizations, which appear due to different mechanism.

Here we use diffusion tractography to identify a reproducible border between dorsal and ventral subregions of human precentral gyrus. We derive connectivity fingerprints for the two subregions and demonstrate that each has a distinctive pattern of connectivity with frontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex, suggesting that these areas correspond to human PMd and PMv. Although putative human PMd has a high probability of connection with the superior parietal lobule, dorsal prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex, human PMv has a higher probability of connection with the anterior inferior parietal lobule and ventral prefrontal cortex. Finally, we assess the correspondence between our PMd/PMv border and local sulcal and functional anatomy. The location of the border falls at the level of the gyral branch that divides the inferior precentral sulcus from the superior precentral sulcus and corresponded closely to the location of a functional border defined using previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.},

abstract = {Bacteria have developed intricate communication capabilities (e.g. quorum-sensing, chemotactic signaling and plasmid exchange) to cooperatively self-organize into highly structured colonies with elevated environmental adaptability. We propose that bacteria use their intracellular flexibility, involving signal transduction networks and genomic plasticity, to collectively maintain linguistic communication: self and shared interpretations of chemical cues, exchange of chemical messages (semantic) and dialogues (pragmatic). Meaning-based communication permits colonial identity, intentional behavior (e.g. pheromone-based courtship for mating), purposeful alteration of colony structure (e.g. formation of fruiting bodies), decision-making (e.g. to sporulate) and the recognition and identification of other colonies - features we might begin to associate with a bacterial social intelligence. Such a social intelligence, should it exist, would require going beyond communication to encompass unknown additional intracellular processes to generate inheritable colonial memory and commonly shared genomic context.},

abstract = {It is well known that auditory deprivation affects the structure and

function of the central nervous system. Congenital deafness represents

one form of deprivation, and in the adult white cat, it has been

shown to have a clear effect upon the synaptic interface between

endbulbs of Held and spherical bushy cells. It is not known, however,

whether all primary synapses are affected and/or whether they are

affected in the same way and to the same extent. Thus, we studied

a second neuronal circuit in the deaf white cat involving modified

(small) endbulbs and globular bushy cells. Compared to normal hearing

cats, modified endbulbs of congenitally deaf cats were 52.2\% smaller

but unchanged in structural complexity. There was also a striking

loss of extracellular space between ending and cell body. The somata

of postsynaptic globular bushy cells were 13.4\% smaller and had

enlarged postsynaptic densities. These data reveal that axosomatic

synapses demonstrate abnormal structure as a consequence of deafness

and that the extent of the abnormalities can vary with respect to

the circuits involved. The implication of these observations is that

synaptic anomalies would introduce differential delays within separate

circuits, thereby desynchronizing neural activity from sound stimuli.

This loss of synchronization could in turn disrupt temporal processing

and compromise a host of related functions, including language comprehension.},

abstract = {Behavioral performance in detection and discrimination tasks is likely
to be limited by the quality and nature of the signals carried by
populations of neurons in early sensory cortical areas. Here we used
voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to directly measure neural population
responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing
a reaction-time detection task. Focusing on the temporal properties
of the population responses, we found that V1 responses are consistent
with a stimulus-evoked response with amplitude and latency that depend
on target contrast and a stimulus-independent additive noise with
long-lasting temporal correlations. The noise had much lower amplitude
than the ongoing activity reported previously in anesthetized animals.
To understand the implications of these properties for subsequent
processing stages that mediate behavior, we derived the Bayesian
ideal observer that specifies how to optimally use neural responses
in reaction time tasks. Using the ideal observer analysis, we show
that 1) the observed temporal correlations limit the performance
benefit that can be attained by accumulating V1 responses over time,
2) a simple temporal decorrelation operation with time-lagged excitation
and inhibition minimizes the detrimental effect of these correlations,
3) the neural information relevant for target detection is concentrated
in the initial response following stimulus onset, and 4) a decoder
that optimally uses V1 responses far outperforms the monkey in both
speed and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that for our particular
detection task, temporal decorrelation followed by an appropriate
running integrator can approach the speed and accuracy of the optimal
decoder.},

Through the use of parametric wideband acoustic stimuli, we found that such neurons in awake marmoset monkeys respond vigorously to wideband sounds having complex spectral shapes, preferring stimuli of either high or low spectral contrast. Low contrast-preferring neurons cannot be studied thoroughly with narrowband stimuli and have not been previously described. These findings indicate that spectral contrast reflects an important stimulus decomposition in auditory cortex and may contribute to the recognition of acoustic objects.},

manner that does not overlay these ideas with complex computer calculations.
The model closely follows the standard calculation, except that it
neglects the small effect of Fermi-Dirac statistics for the leptons.
The temperature difference between photons and neutrinos during the
period in which neurtons and protons interconvert is also neglected.
These approximations permit the expression of neutron-proton conversion
rates in a closed form, which agrees to 10\% accuracy or better with
the exact rates. Using these analytic expressions for the rates,
the authors reduce the calculation of the neutron-proton ratio as
a function of temperature to a simple numerical integral. They also
estimate the effect of neutron decay on the helium abundance. Their
result for this quantity agrees well with precise computer calculations.
Their semianalytic formulas are used to determine how the preducted
helium abundance varies with such parameters as the neutron lifetime,
the baryon-to-photon ratio, the number of neutrino species, and a
possible electron-neutrino chemical potential.},

abstract = {Dendritic spines are critical elements of cortical circuits, since they establish most excitatory synapses. Recent studies have reported correlations between morphological and functional parameters of spines. Specifically, the spine head volume is correlated with the area of the postsynaptic density (PSD), the number of postsynaptic receptors and the ready-releasable pool of transmitter, whereas the length of the spine neck is proportional to the degree of biochemical and electrical isolation of the spine from its parent dendrite. Therefore, the morphology of a spine could determine its synaptic strength and learning rules.To better understand the natural variability of neocortical spine morphologies, we used a combination of gold-toned Golgi impregnations and serial thin-section electron microscopy and performed three-dimensional reconstructions of spines from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells from mouse visual cortex. We characterized the structure and synaptic features of 144 completed reconstructed spines, and analyzed their morphologies according to their positions. For all morphological parameters analyzed, spines exhibited a continuum of variability, without clearly distinguishable subtypes of spines or clear dependence of their morphologies on their distance to the soma. On average, the spine head volume was correlated strongly with PSD area and weakly with neck diameter, but not with neck length. The large morphological diversity suggests an equally large variability of synaptic strength and learning rules.},

Although the reported functional differences are generally consistent, the structural differences are controversial among the various studies. In this study, we particularly focused on the gender-related effect in the gray matter (GM). We performed a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in 184 healthy adults (90 males and 94 females) with ages ranging from 18 to 70years. Cortical thickness was measured using an automated surface-based method. Based on this surface morphological feature of GM, we first compared their regional differences between males and females. We then constructed the morphometry-based anatomical networks derived from cortical thickness measurement, while the anatomical connection between two cortical areas depended upon the statistical dependence of their cortical thickness across subjects. Subsequently, we applied graph theoretical approaches to investigate the properties of the resultant anatomical networks. The results showed that the significant gender-related differences of cortical thickness appeared extensively in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. And there were also some between-group differences in the interregional correlation. Additional graph theoretical analysis on the morphological networks revealed both networks exhibited the small-world efficiency and their patterns of topological vulnerability had no statistical differences. The findings on the large sample may provide the evidences to study the gender consistency and difference in the human brain structures.},

abstract = {We evaluated the consequences of neonatal cochlear destruction upon

ascending projections to the inferior colliculi. Unilateral cochlear

ablations were performed in both neonatal and adult gerbils. Four

to 12 months later, the inferior colliculus (IC) was examined physiologically

and injected unilaterally with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The

number of labeled cells was determined bilaterally in all three divisions

of cochlear nucleus (CN) and in the medial superior olive (MSO).

In both experimental groups, transneuronal changes within the deafferented

CN were greater in the ventral divisions than in the dorsal division.

On the unoperated side the magnitude of projections from CN to the

inferior colliculi was altered in animals lesioned as neonates. Following

HRP injections into the IC on the unoperated side, the number of

ipsilaterally labeled cells in CN (unoperated side) was significantly

greater in the neonatal experimental group than in adult experimental

and control animals. These anatomical changes were accompanied by

increased ipsilaterally evoked excitatory activity recorded in the

IC on the unoperated side. Following HRP injections into the IC on

the ablated side, the number of contralaterally labeled cells in

CN (unoperated side) was significantly reduced in animals lesioned

as neonates as compared with control animals. The number of labeled

cells in ipsilateral MSO was not significantly different across groups.

Our interpretation is that unilateral cochlear ablation in neonatal

gerbils results in an increase in the magnitude of ipsilateral projections

and a decrease in the magnitude of contralateral projections from

CN on the unoperated side to the inferior colliculi. These data suggest

that the normal pattern of innervation of the IC results, in part,

from interactions among afferent projections.},

abstract = {This paper describes a general nonlinear dynamical model for neural system identification. It describes an algorithm for fitting a simple form of the model to spike train data, and reports on this algorithm's performance in identifying the structure and parameters of simulated neurons. The central element of the model is a Wiener-Bose dynamic nonlinearity that ensures that the model is able to approximate the behaviour of an arbitrary nonlinear dynamical system. Nonlinearities associated with spike generation and transmission are treated by placing the Wiener-Bose system in cascade with pulse frequency modulators and demodulators, and the static nonlinearity at the output of the Wiener-Bose system is decomposed into a rectifier and a multinomial. This simplifies the model without reducing its generality for neuronal system identification. Model elements can be characterised using standard methods of dynamical systems analysis, and the model has a simple form that can be implemented and simulated efficiently. This model bears a structural resemblance to real neurons; it may be regarded as a connectionist "neuron" that has been generalized in a realistic way to enable it to mimic the behaviour of an arbitrary nonlinear system, or conversely as a general nonlinear model that has been constrained to make it easy to fit to spike train data. Tests with simulated data show that the identification algorithm can accurately estimate the structure and parameters of neuron-like nonlinear dynamical systems using data sets containing only a few hundred spikes.},

So far, no single study has been able to incorporate all these parameters in a meaningful way that would allow separation of these often highly correlated variables. This paper introduces a three-dimensional, seven degree-of-freedom computational musculoskeletal model of the macaque arm that translates the coordinates of eight tracking markers placed on the arm into joint angles, joint torques, musculotendon lengths and finally into an optimized prediction of muscle forces. This paper uses this model to illustrate how the classic center-out reaching task used by many researchers over the last 20 years is not optimal in separating out intrinsic, extrinsic, kinematic and kinetic variables. However, by using the musculoskeletal model to design and test novel behavioral movement tasks, a priori, it is possible to disassociate the myriad of movement parameters in motor neurophysiological reaching studies.},

abstract = {Anatomical and physiological auditory data and pitch measurements are presented including some additional analysis. The data provide the basis for a new computer model of sustained chopper neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus. New and old evidence indicating a preference for multiples of 0.4 ms in oscillations of chopper neurons in the cochlear nucleus of different species such as man, cats, and Guinea fowls, is summarized. Our hypothesis is that the time constant of 0.4 ms is due to the minimum synaptic delay of chopper neuron connections. Anatomical findings show that chopper neurons are indeed connected and can excite each other; a model of a circular network of neurons that are connected via synapses with a delay of 0.4 ms is thus plausible. Results concerning frequency tuning and dynamical properties of periodicity encoding of chopper neurons are reviewed. It is concluded that chopper neurons receive input both from auditory nerve fibres and onset neurons.},

Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex.

abstract = {The execution of reaching movements involves the coordinated activity of multiple brain regions that relate variously to the desired target and a path of arm states to achieve that target. These arm states may represent positions, velocities, torques, or other quantities. Estimation has been previously applied to neural activity in reconstructing the target separately from the path. However, the target and path are not independent. Because arm movements are limited by finite muscle contractility, knowledge of the target constrains the path of states that leads to the target. In this letter, we derive and illustrate a state equation to capture this basic dependency between target and path. The solution is described for discrete-time linear systems and gaussian increments with known target arrival time. The resulting analysis enables the use of estimation to study how brain regions that relate variously to target and path together specify a trajectory. The corresponding reconstruction procedure may also be useful in brain-driven prosthetic devices to generate control signals for goal-directed movements.},

Once estimated, this component may be subtracted from the covariogram, leaving only other types of contributions.

abstract = {In her initial research, Elizabeth D. Hay studied amphibian limb regeneration,
but later switched her focus, and for the remainder of her career
addressed the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulating
embryonic morphogenesis. Much of that work used the embryonic chick
corneal epithelial model. This review highlights many of the discoveries
that she made using this model. Hay was the first to show that embryonic
corneal epithelial cells produce fibrillar collagen. Her lab was
among the first to demonstrate that corneal epithelial cells respond
to a collagenous substrate by increasing ECM production, and that
purified ECM molecules, added to cultures of epithelial sheets, induce
a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These data led to the
first theories of cell-matrix interactions, illustrated in a 'hands
across the membrane' sketch drawn by Hay. Recent work with the epithelial
sheet model system has elucidated many of the signal transduction
pathways required for actin reorganization in response to the ECM.
In all, this body of work has amply supported Hay's belief that the
embryonic corneal epithelium is a powerful model system for exploring
the role of the ECM in regulating the cytoskeleton, in directing
cell migration, and in profoundly influencing cell growth and differentiation
during development.},

@article{Collins2005a,
abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying the sense of joint position and movement remain controversial. While cutaneous receptors are known to contribute to kinesthesia for the fingers, the present experiments test the hypothesis that they contribute at other major joints. Illusory movements were evoked at the interphalangeal (IP) joints of the index finger, the elbow, and the knee by stimulation of populations of cutaneous and muscle spindle receptors, both separately and together. Subjects matched perceived movements with voluntary movements of homologous joints on the contralateral side. Cutaneous receptors were activated by stretch of the skin (using 2 intensities of stretch) and vibration activated muscle spindle receptors. Stimuli were designed to activate receptors that discharge during joint flexion. For the index finger, vibration was applied over the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the hand, to evoke illusory metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion, and skin stretch was delivered around the IP joints. The strong skin stretch evoked the illusion of flexion of the proximal IP joint in 6/8 subjects (12 +/- 5 degrees, mean +/- SE). For the group, strong skin stretch delivered during vibration increased the perceived flexion of the proximal IP joint by eight times with a concomitant decrease in perceived flexion of the MCP joint compared with vibration alone (P < 0.05). For the elbow, vibration was applied over the distal tendon of triceps brachii and skin stretch over the dorsal forearm. When delivered alone, strong skin stretch evoked illusory elbow flexion in 5/10 subjects (9 +/- 4 degrees). Simultaneous strong skin stretch and vibration increased the illusory elbow flexion for the group by 1.5 times compared with vibration (P < 0.05). For the knee, vibration was applied over the patellar tendon and skin stretch over the thigh. Skin stretch alone evoked illusory knee flexion in 3/10 subjects (8 +/- 4 degrees) and when delivered during vibration, perceived knee flexion increased for the group by 1.4 times compared with vibration (P < 0.05). Hence inputs from cutaneous receptors, muscle receptors, and combined inputs from both receptors likely subserve kinesthesia at joints throughout the body.},

microscope is not used with the correct coverslip or immersion oil,

when the detector is not located at the optimal plane in image space,

or when the object does not satisfy specific conditions, aberration

will degrade both the contrast and the resolution of the image. In

biology the most severe aberration is introduced when an oil-immersion

objective lens is used to study thick specimens, such as living cells

and tissues, whose refractive indices are significantly different

from that of the immersion oil. We present a model of the three-dimensional

imaging properties of a fluorescence light microscope subject to

such aberration and compare the imaging properties predicted by the

model with those measured experimentally. The model can be used to

understand and compensate for aberration introduced to a microscope

system under nondesign optical conditions so that both confocal laser

With only five olfactory neurons, C. elegans can dynamically respond

enable the nematode to remember its cultivation temperature and to
track narrow isotherms. Polymodal sensory neurons detect a wide range

sensory stimuli leads to long-lived changes in behavior consistent
with associative learning. Worms exhibit social behaviors and complex

abstract = {We investigated object representation in area TE, the anterior part of monkey inferotemporal (IT) cortex, with a combination of optical and extracellular recordings in anesthetized monkeys. We found neurons that respond to visual stimuli composed of naturally distinguishable parts. These neurons were sensitive to a particular spatial arrangement of parts but less sensitive to differences in local features within individual parts. Thus these neurons were activated when arbitrary local features were arranged in a particular spatial configuration, suggesting that they may be responsible for representing the spatial configuration of object images. Previously it has been reported that many neurons in area TE respond to visual features less complex than natural objects, but it has remained unclear whether these features are related to local features of object images or to more global features. These results indicate that TE neurons represent not only local features but also global features such as the spatial relationship among object parts.},

abstract = {Reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) are GFP-like proteins that may be repeatedly switched by irradiation with light from a fluorescent to a nonfluorescent state, and vice versa. They can be utilized as genetically encodable probes and bear large potential for a wide array of applications, in particular for new protein tracking schemes and subdiffraction resolution microscopy. However, the currently described monomeric RSFPs emit only blue-green or green fluorescence; the spectral window for their use is thus rather limited. Using a semirational engineering approach based on the crystal structure of the monomeric nonswitchable red fluorescent protein mCherry, we generated rsCherry and rsCherryRev. These two novel red fluorescent RSFPs exhibit fluorescence emission maxima at approximately 610 nm. They display antagonistic switching modes, i.e., in rsCherry irradiation with yellow light induces the off-to-on transition and blue light the on-to-off transition, whereas in rsCherryRev the effects of the switching wavelengths are reversed. We demonstrate time-lapse live-cell subdiffraction microscopy by imaging rsCherryRev targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum utilizing the switching and localization of single molecules.},

abstract = {Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) was introduced by Spergel \& Steinhardt
to address possible discrepancies between collisionless dark matter
simulations and observations on scales of less than 1 Mpc. We examine
the case in which dark matter particles not only have strong self-interactions
but also have strong interactions with baryons. The presence of such
interactions will have direct implications for nuclear and particle
astrophysics. Among these are a change in the predicted abundances
from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the flux of \^{I}³-rays produced
by the decay of neutral pions which originate in collisions between
dark matter and Galactic cosmic rays (CR). From these effects we
constrain the strength of the baryon\^{A}–dark matter interactions through
the ratio of baryon - dark matter interaction cross section to dark
matter mass, s. We find that BBN places a weak upper limit to this
ratio <\^{a}ˆ¼ 108 cm2 g\^{a}ˆ’1. CR-SIDM interactions, however, limit the
possible DM-baryon cross section to <\^{a}ˆ¼ 5 \~{A}— 10\^{a}ˆ’3 cm2 g\^{a}ˆ’1; this
rules out an energy-independent interaction, but not one which falls

abstract = {The analysis of extra-cellular neural recordings typically begins with careful spike sorting and all analysis of the data then rests on the correctness of the resulting spike trains. In many situations this is unproblematic as experimental and spike sorting procedures often focus on well isolated units. There is evidence in the literature, however, that errors in spike sorting can occur even with carefully collected and selected data. Additionally, chronically implanted electrodes and arrays with fixed electrodes cannot be easily adjusted to provide well isolated units. In these situations, multiple units may be recorded and the assignment of waveforms to units may be ambiguous. At the same time, analysis of such data may be both scientifically important and clinically relevant. In this paper we address this issue using a novel probabilistic model that accounts for several important sources of uncertainty and error in spike sorting. In lieu of sorting neural data to produce a single best spike train, we estimate a probabilistic model of spike trains given the observed data. We show how such a distribution over spike sortings can support standard neuroscientific questions while providing a representation of uncertainty in the analysis. As a representative illustration of the approach, we analyzed primary motor cortical tuning with respect to hand movement in data recorded with a chronic multi-electrode array in non-human primates. We found that the probabilistic analysis generally agrees with human sorters but suggests the presence of tuned units not detected by humans.},

The second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D) has been proposed as a marker of these prenatal androgen effects, a relatively longer fourth finger indicating higher prenatal androgen exposure. 2D:4D has been shown to predict success in highly competitive sports. Yet, little is known about the effects of prenatal androgens on an economically influential class of competitive risk taking-trading in the financial world. Here, we report the findings of a study conducted in the City of London in which we sampled 2D:4D from a group of male traders engaged in what is variously called "noise" or "high-frequency" trading. We found that 2D:4D predicted the traders' long-term profitability as well as the number of years they remained in the business. 2D:4D also predicted the sensitivity of their profitability to increases both in circulating testosterone and in market volatility. Our results suggest that prenatal androgens increase risk preferences and promote more rapid visuomotor scanning and physical reflexes. The success and longevity of traders exposed to high levels of prenatal androgens further suggests that financial markets may select for biological traits rather than rational expectations.},

abstract = {There has recently been a great deal of interest in inferring network connectivity from the spike trains in populations of neurons. One class of useful models that can be fit easily to spiking data is based on generalized linear point process models from statistics. Once the parameters for these models are fit, the analyst is left with a nonlinear spiking network model with delays, which in general may be very difficult to understand analytically. Here we develop mean-field methods for approximating the stimulus-driven firing rates (in both the time-varying and steady-state cases), auto- and cross-correlations, and stimulus-dependent filtering properties of these networks. These approximations are valid when the contributions of individual network coupling terms are small and, hence, the total input to a neuron is approximately gaussian. These approximations lead to deterministic ordinary differential equations that are much easier to solve and analyze than direct Monte Carlo simulation of the network activity. These approximations also provide an analytical way to evaluate the linear input-output filter of neurons and how the filters are modulated by network interactions and some stimulus feature. Finally, in the case of strong refractory effects, the mean-field approximations in the generalized linear model become inaccurate; therefore, we introduce a model that captures strong refractoriness, retains all of the easy fitting properties of the standard generalized linear model, and leads to much more accurate approximations of mean firing rates and cross-correlations that retain fine temporal behaviors.},

abstract = {Optimal filtering of noisy voltage signals on dendritic trees is a key problem in computational cellular neuroscience. However, the state variable in this problem-the vector of voltages at every compartment-is very high-dimensional: realistic multicompartmental models often have on the order of N = 10(4) compartments. Standard implementations of the Kalman filter require O(N (3)) time and O(N (2)) space, and are therefore impractical. Here we take advantage of three special features of the dendritic filtering problem to construct an efficient filter: (1) dendritic dynamics are governed by a cable equation on a tree, which may be solved using sparse matrix methods in O(N) time; and current methods for observing dendritic voltage (2) provide low SNR observations and (3) only image a relatively small number of compartments at a time. The idea is to approximate the Kalman equations in terms of a low-rank perturbation of the steady-state (zero-SNR) solution, which may be obtained in O(N) time using methods that exploit the sparse tree structure of dendritic dynamics. The resulting methods give a very good approximation to the exact Kalman solution, but only require O(N) time and space. We illustrate the method with applications to real and simulated dendritic branching structures, and describe how to extend the techniques to incorporate spatially subsampled, temporally filtered, and nonlinearly transformed observations.},

abstract = {1. We characterized the kinetics of presynaptic Ca2+ ion concentration

in optic nerve fibers and terminals of the optic tectum in Rana pipiens

with the use of microfluorimetry. Isolated frog brains were incubated

with the membrane-permeant tetraacetoxymethyl ester (AM) of the Ca2+

indicator fura-2. An optic nerve shock caused a transient decrease

in the 380-nm excited fluorescence in the optic tectum with a rise

time of <15 ms and a recovery to prestimulus levels on a time scale

of seconds. 2. In normal saline, the amplitude of the fluorescence

transients was dependent on stimulus intensity and at all levels

it was directly correlated with the amplitude of postsynaptic field

potentials produced by activation of unmyelinated optic nerve fibers.

In the presence of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor

antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, the amplitude and

time course of fluorescence transients remained essentially unchanged

while postsynaptic field potential amplitude was greatly reduced.

Replacing extracellular Ca2+ with Ba2+ blocked unfacilitated postsynaptic

field potentials while fluorescence transients remained significant.

In reduced-Ca2+ salines (<1 mM), the amplitude of fluorescence transients

increased approximately linearly with extracellular [Ca2+], whereas

the amplitude the corresponding field potential was nonlinearly related

to the fluorescent transient amplitude (approximately 2.5 power).

In thin sections of labeled tecta, fluorescence labeling was localized

to 1-micron puncta in the termination zone of optic nerve fibers

in the superficial layers. Taken together, these results provide

strong evidence that the fluorescence transients correspond to an

increase in Ca2+ in presynaptic terminals of unmyelinated optic nerve

fibers. 3. During trains of optic nerve stimulation, the amplitude

of fluorescence transients to succeeding action potentials became

smaller. The decrement of the amplitudes was not observed in mag-fura-5-labeled

tecta, when the intracellular Ca2+ buffering capacity of fura-2-labeled

terminals was increased by incubation with bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic

acid (BAPTA)-AM or ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic

acid (EGTA)-AM, or in low-Ca2+ saline. We conclude that the Ca2+

influx per action potential is constant during the train and that

the reduced response was produced by saturation of the fura-2. We

provide a mathematical analysis of this saturation effect and use

it to estimate the Ca2+ change per action potential. 4. Both BAPTA-AM

and EGTA-AM reduced the overall amplitude of fura-2-measured Ca2+

transients and reduced the saturation effect in action potential

trains. However, there was a qualitative difference in their effects

on the shape of the transient. Incubation with the fast buffer BAPTA

prolonged the decay to baseline. In contrast, the slow buffer EGTA

(or EDTA) produced an initial decay faster than the control condition

while also producing the slower subsequent phase observed with BAPTA.

We demonstrate that these results are consistent with numerical simulations

of Ca2+ dynamics in a single-compartment model where the fast initial

decay is produced by the forward rate of Ca2+ binding to EGTA. 5.

Ca2+ influx into tectal presynaptic structures, and also into unmyelinated

axons in the isolated optic nerve, was diminished (60-70\%) in the

presence of the voltage-activated Ca2+ channel blocker omega-conotoxin

GVIA, but was only weakly affected (approximately 10\%) by omega-agatoxin

IVA. 6. After 10- to 50-Hz stimulus trains, synaptic enhancement

of unmyelinated fibers decayed with a characteristic time similar

to fura-2 fluorescence decays. Incubation with EDTA-AM or EGTA-AM

produced little effect on evoked release but reduced both the amplitude

of the fura-2-measured Ca2+ transient and the amplitude of short-term

synaptic enhancement.},

Early single-neuron recording research treated spike pattern variability as noise that needed to be averaged out to reveal the brain's representation of invariant input. Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron-electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

abstract = {Neural spike train decoding algorithms and techniques to compute Shannon mutual information are important methods for analyzing how neural systems represent biological signals. Decoding algorithms are also one of several strategies being used to design controls for brain-machine interfaces. Developing optimal strategies to design decoding algorithms and compute mutual information are therefore important problems in computational neuroscience. We present a general recursive filter decoding algorithm based on a point process model of individual neuron spiking activity and a linear stochastic state-space model of the biological signal. We derive from the algorithm new instantaneous estimates of the entropy, entropy rate, and the mutual information between the signal and the ensemble spiking activity. We assess the accuracy of the algorithm by computing, along with the decoding error, the true coverage probability of the approximate 0.95 confidence regions for the individual signal estimates. We illustrate the new algorithm by reanalyzing the position and ensemble neural spiking activity of CA1 hippocampal neurons from two rats foraging in an open circular environment. We compare the performance of this algorithm with a linear filter constructed by the widely used reverse correlation method. The median decoding error for Animal 1 (2) during 10 minutes of open foraging was 5.9 (5.5) cm, the median entropy was 6.9 (7.0) bits, the median information was 9.4 (9.4) bits, and the true coverage probability for 0.95 confidence regions was 0.67 (0.75) using 34 (32) neurons. These findings improve significantly on our previous results and suggest an integrated approach to dynamically reading neural codes, measuring their properties, and quantifying the accuracy with which encoded information is extracted.},

However, repeated targeting of a single locus remains a practice mostly limited to unicellular organisms that afford simple targeting methodologies. We developed an efficient method to repeatedly target a single locus in Drosophila. In this method, which we term "site-specific integrase mediated repeated targeting" (SIRT), an attP attachment site for the phage phiC31 integrase is first targeted to the vicinity of the gene of interest by homologous recombination. All subsequent modifications of that gene are introduced by phiC31-mediated integration of plasmids carrying an attB attachment site and the desired mutation. This highly efficient integration results in a tandem duplication of the target locus, which is then reduced into a single copy carrying the mutation, likely by the efficient "single strand annealing" mechanism, induced with a DNA double-strand break (DSB). We used SIRT to generate a series of six mutations in the Drosophila nbs gene, ranging from single amino acid replacements and small in-frame deletions to complete deletion of the gene. Because all of the components of SIRT are functional in many different organisms, it is readily adaptable to other multicellular organisms.},

@article{Martel1998,
abstract = {A set of cosmological variables, which we shall refer to as \"{\i}¾‘supercomoving
variables\"{\i}¾’, are presented which are an alternative to the standard
comoving variables, particularly useful for describing the gas dynamics
of cosmic structure formation. For an ideal gas with a ratio of specific
heats g \^{A}¼ 5=3, the supercomoving position, velocity and thermodynamic
properties (i.e. density, temperature and pressure) of matter are
constant in time in a uniform, isotropic, adiabatically expanding
universe. Expressed in terms of these supercomoving variables, the
non-relativistic, cosmological fluid conservation equations of the
Newtonian approximation and the Poisson equation closely resemble
their non-cosmological counterparts. This makes it possible to generalize
non-cosmological results and techniques to address problems involving
departures from uniform, adiabatic Hubble expansion in a straightforward
way, for a wide range of cosmological models. These variables were
initially introduced by Shandarin to describe structure formation
in matter-dominated models. In this paper, we generalize supercomoving
variables to models with a uniform contribution to the energy density
corresponding to a non-zero cosmological constant, domain walls,
cosmic strings, a nonclumping form of non-relativistic matter (e.g.
massive neutrinos in the presence of primordial density fluctuations
of small wavelength) or a radiation background. Each model is characterized
by the value of the density parameter Q0 of the non-relativistic
matter component in which density fluctuation is possible, and the
density parameter QX0 of the additional nonclumping component. For
each type of non-clumping background, we identify families within
which different values of Q0 and QX0 lead to fluid equations and
solutions in supercomoving variables which are independent of the
cosmological parameters Q0 and QX0. We also generalize the description
to include the effects of non-adiabatic processes such as heating,
radiative cooling, thermal conduction and viscosity, as well as magnetic
fields in the MHD approximation. As an illustration, we describe
three familiar cosmological problems in supercomoving variables:
the growth of linear density fluctuations, the non-linear collapse
of a 1D plane-wave density fluctuation leading to pancake formation,
and the well-known Zel\"{\i}¾’dovich approximation for extrapolating the
linear growth of density fluctuations in three dimensions to the
non-linear stage.},

Apart from humans and apes, dolphins and elephants are also known for such capacities. After the recent discovery of MSR in dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), elephants thus were the next logical candidate species. We exposed three Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) to a large mirror to investigate their responses. Animals that possess MSR typically progress through four stages of behavior when facing a mirror: (i) social responses, (ii) physical inspection (e.g., looking behind the mirror), (iii) repetitive mirror-testing behavior, and (iv) realization of seeing themselves. Visible marks and invisible sham-marks were applied to the elephants' heads to test whether they would pass the litmus "mark test" for MSR in which an individual spontaneously uses a mirror to touch an otherwise imperceptible mark on its own body. Here, we report a successful MSR elephant study and report striking parallels in the progression of responses to mirrors among apes, dolphins, and elephants. These parallels suggest convergent cognitive evolution most likely related to complex sociality and cooperation.},

abstract = {To investigate the basis of the fluctuating activity present in neocortical neurons in vivo, we have combined computational models with whole-cell recordings using the dynamic-clamp technique. A simplified 'point-conductance' model was used to represent the currents generated by thousands of stochastically releasing synapses. Synaptic activity was represented by two independent fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances described by stochastic random-walk processes. An advantage of this approach is that all the model parameters can be determined from voltage-clamp experiments. We show that the point-conductance model captures the amplitude and spectral characteristics of the synaptic conductances during background activity. To determine if it can recreate in vivo-like activity, we injected this point-conductance model into a single-compartment model, or in rat prefrontal cortical neurons in vitro using dynamic clamp. This procedure successfully recreated several properties of neurons intracellularly recorded in vivo, such as a depolarized membrane potential, the presence of high-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations, a low-input resistance and irregular spontaneous firing activity. In addition, the point-conductance model could simulate the enhancement of responsiveness due to background activity. We conclude that many of the characteristics of cortical neurons in vivo can be explained by fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances varying stochastically.},

This approach allows for quantitative comparison of operations of neural junctions across systems, and an interpretation of their connectivity parameters in terms of the flow of multiunit firing patterns. The paper further uses this characterization to show how to rationally construct reduced operational models of neural junctions. Both uniformly proportional scaling and partial fragmentary representations are developed. The uniformly scaled models are better adapted to overall capacities and broader theoretical conceptualizations; the partial representations are better adapted to direct comparison with microelectrode experimentation. The characterization of information flow is based on coordinated multiunit patterns such as synfire chains or sequential configurations. The system can be applied to component parts of large composite networks including junctions with topographical patchiness and other irregularities. The characterization should be of use to anatomists, physiologists, modelers, and theorists. The theory predicts that the necessity for cooperative confluence of synaptic potentials in sending and receiving sequential configurations across topographically constrained projection fields requires the existence of functional 'pattern modules' within the topographical synaptology of the junction.},

observed in all layers of the hippocampus proper and fascia dentata
with a preponderance in zones adjacent to the hippocampal fissure
and in the part of CA1 bordering the subiculum. All immunoreactive
cells found were non-pyramidal neurons. They were relatively small

Electron-microscopic analysis of ChAT-immunoreactive cells in the
hippocampus and fascia dentata revealed synaptic contacts, mainly
of the asymmetric type, on cell bodies and smooth proximal dendrites.
The nuclei of the immunoreactive cells exhibited deep indentations,

abstract = {An understanding of the logic of odor perception requires a functional analysis of odor-evoked patterns of activity in neural assemblies in the brain. We have developed a sensitive imaging system in the Drosophila brain that couples two-photon microscopy with the specific expression of the calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein, G-CaMP. At natural odor concentration, each odor elicits a distinct and sparse spatial pattern of activity in the antennal lobe that is conserved in different flies. Patterns of glomerular activity are similar upon imaging of sensory and projection neurons, suggesting the faithful transmission of sensory input to higher brain centers. Finally, we demonstrate that the response pattern of a given glomerulus is a function of the specificity of a single odorant receptor. The development of this imaging system affords an opportunity to monitor activity in defined neurons throughout the fly brain with high sensitivity and excellent spatial resolution.},

abstract = {Many synapses can change their strength rapidly in a use-dependent

manner, but the mechanisms of such short-term plasticity remain unknown.

To understand these mechanisms, measurements of neurotransmitter

release at single synapses are required. We probed transmitter release

by imaging transient increases in [\{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\}] mediated by synaptic

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in individual dendritic spines

of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices, enabling quantal analysis

at single synapses. We found that changes in release probability,

produced by paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) or by manipulation of

presynaptic adenosine receptors, were associated with changes in

glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft, indicating that single

synapses can release a variable amount of glutamate per action potential.

The relationship between release probability and response size is

consistent with a binomial model of vesicle release with several

(>5) independent release sites per active zone, suggesting that multivesicular

release contributes to facilitation at these synapses.},

abstract = {Memory trace reactivation in hippocampal ensembles during sleep has been suggested as a coordinating mechanism for consolidation of new memories. Here we propose a simple statistical scheme allowing analysis of the reactivation of firing rate modulations, with a well-defined null hypothesis. This method allowed reliable detection of ensemble reactivation across three experimental settings. Reactivation of firing rate modulations mirrors several properties of commonly studied reactivation measures: it is stronger during hippocampal sharp waves, and decays over a period of 10-20 min. Moreover, in some conditions, firing rate reactivation covaries with reactivation of cell pair cross-correlations, suggesting the two phenomena reflect similar processes. We propose an attractor network model, with pre-wired attractors, in which experience selects and primes some attractors. Priming occurs by either experience dependent synaptic plasticity or changes in neuronal excitability. Primed attractors are more likely to activate in the following sleep, inducing reactivation of both rates and cross-correlations.},

A controversial but untested idea is that this is achieved by simulating the other person's mental processes in one's own mind. If this is the case, then the same neural systems activated by a mental function should re-activate when one thinks about that function performed by another. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested whether the neural processes involved in preparing one's own actions are also used for predicting the future actions of others. We provide compelling evidence that areas within the action control system of the human brain are indeed activated when predicting others' actions, but a different action sub-system is activated when preparing one's own actions.},

abstract = {Although many properties of the nervous system are shared among animals
and systems, it is not known whether different neuronal circuits
use common strategies to guide behaviour. Here we characterize information
processing by Caenorhabditis elegans olfactory neurons (AWC) and
interneurons (AIB and AIY) that control food- and odour-evoked behaviours.
Using calcium imaging and mutations that affect specific neuronal
connections, we show that AWC neurons are activated by odour removal
and activate the AIB interneurons through AMPA-type glutamate receptors.
The level of calcium in AIB interneurons is elevated for several
minutes after odour removal, a neuronal correlate to the prolonged
behavioural response to odour withdrawal. The AWC neuron inhibits
AIY interneurons through glutamate-gated chloride channels; odour
presentation relieves this inhibition and results in activation of
AIY interneurons. The opposite regulation of AIY and AIB interneurons
generates a coordinated behavioural response. Information processing
by this circuit resembles information flow from vertebrate photoreceptors
to 'OFF' bipolar and 'ON' bipolar neurons, indicating a conserved
or convergent strategy for sensory information processing.},

This analysis gives the theoretical absolute bandwidth of the restored image; however, this absolute value may not be realistic in many cases.

We realized these advances by quantifying, analyzing, and thereby minimizing the dynamics of photodamage (PD), a frequent limiting factor in the optical imaging of biological preparations. The optical signal and the PD during SHG imaging of stained cultured Aplysia neurons were examined with intracellular electrode recordings monitoring the resting Vm variations induced by laser-scanning illumination. We found that the PD increased linearly with the dye concentration but grew with the cube of illumination intensity, leading to unanticipated optimization procedures to minimize PD. The addition of appropriate antioxidants in conjunction with an observed Vm recovery after termination of laser scanning further refined the imaging criteria for minimization and control of PD during SHG recording of action potentials. With these advances, the potential of SHG as an effective optical tool for neuroscience investigations is being realized.},

This type of prior allows us to conveniently model the number of clusters and estimate its posterior distribution directly from the data. An important benefit of using Bayesian modelling is the extension to multiple subjects clustering via a hierarchical mixture of Dirichlet processes. Data from different subjects are used to infer on class parameters and the number of classes at individual and group level.

abstract = {Two-photon microscopy (TPM) revolutionized Ca2+ imaging by allowing recordings in the depth of intact tissue and live organisms. A serious limitation in TPM, however, is the lack of an accurate and straightforward approach for the quantification of Ca2+ signals, an ability that became an invaluable tool in fluorescence microscopy. Here, we present time-correlated fluorescence lifetime imaging (tcFLIM) as a ratiometric method for the quantification of Ca2+ signals in TPM. The fluorescence lifetime of the Ca2+-indicator dye Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1) can be recorded using the approximately 80 MHz excitation pulses utilized in TPM. It shows a Ca2+ dependence that can be explained by the Ca2+-affinity, spectral properties and purity of the dye. Pixel-wise lifetime recordings, controlled by a laser-scanning microscope, allowed quantitative Ca2+ imaging in full-frame and linescan mode. Although we focused on the high-affinity Ca2+ indicator OGB-1, our tcFLIM-based quantification is applicable to other Ca2+ dyes and to fluorescence indicators in general.},

abstract = {A striking feature of many sensory processing problems is that there appear to be many more neurons engaged in the internal representations of the signal than in its transduction. For example, humans have approximately 30,000 cochlear neurons, but at least 1000 times as many neurons in the auditory cortex. Such apparently redundant internal representations have sometimes been proposed as necessary to overcome neuronal noise. We instead posit that they directly subserve computations of interest. Here we provide an example of how sparse overcomplete linear representations can directly solve difficult acoustic signal processing problems, using as an example monaural source separation using solely the cues provided by the differential filtering imposed on a source by its path from its origin to the cochlea [the head-related transfer function (HRTF)]. In contrast to much previous work, the HRTF is used here to separate auditory streams rather than to localize them in space. The experimentally testable predictions that arise from this model, including a novel method for estimating the optimal stimulus of a neuron using data from a multineuron recording experiment, are generic and apply to a wide range of sensory computations.},

These findings suggest that activation of distinct neural circuits related to anticipatory affect precedes and supports consumers' purchasing decisions.},

We found that a trader's morning testosterone level predicts his day's profitability. We also found that a trader's cortisol rises with both the variance of his trading results and the volatility of the market. Our results suggest that higher testosterone may contribute to economic return, whereas cortisol is increased by risk. Our results point to a further possibility: testosterone and cortisol are known to have cognitive and behavioral effects, so if the acutely elevated steroids we observed were to persist or increase as volatility rises, they may shift risk preferences and even affect a trader's ability to engage in rational choice.},

abstract = {Due to cellular complexity, studying fast signaling in neurons is often limited by: 1. the number of sites that can be simultaneously probed with conventional tools, such as patch pipettes, and 2. the recording speed of imaging tools, such as confocal or multiphoton microscopy. To overcome these spatiotemporal limitations, we develop an addressable confocal microscope that permits concurrent optical recordings from multiple user-selected sites of interest at high frame rates. Our system utilizes acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) for rapid positioning of a focused laser beam and a digital micromirror device (DMD) for addressable spatial filtering to achieve confocality. A registration algorithm synchronizes the AODs and DMD such that point illumination and point detection are always colocalized in conjugate image planes. The current system has an adjustable spatial resolution of approximately 0.5 to 1 microm. Furthermore, we show that recordings can be made at an aggregate frame rate of approximately 40 kHz. The system is capable of optical sectioning; this property is used to create 3-D reconstructions of fluorescently labeled test specimens and visualize neurons in brain slices. Additionally, we use the system to record intracellular calcium transients at several sites in hippocampal neurons using the fluorescent calcium indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1.},

@article{Yaksi2007,
abstract = {Odors are initially represented in the olfactory bulb (OB) by patterns of sensory input across the array of glomeruli. Although activated glomeruli are often widely distributed, glomeruli responding to stimuli sharing molecular features tend to be loosely clustered and thus establish a fractured chemotopic map. Neuronal circuits in the OB transform glomerular patterns of sensory input into spatiotemporal patterns of output activity and thereby extract information about a stimulus. It is, however, unknown whether the chemotopic spatial organization of glomerular inputs is maintained during these computations. To explore this issue, we measured spatiotemporal patterns of odor-evoked activity across thousands of individual neurons in the zebrafish OB by temporally deconvolved two-photon Ca(2+) imaging. Mitral cells and interneurons were distinguished by transgenic markers and exhibited different response selectivities. Shortly after response onset, activity patterns exhibited foci of activity associated with certain chemical features throughout all layers. During the subsequent few hundred milliseconds, however, MC activity was locally sparsened within the initial foci in an odor-specific manner. As a consequence, chemotopic maps disappeared and activity patterns became more informative about precise odor identity. Hence, chemotopic maps of glomerular input activity are initially transmitted to OB outputs, but not maintained during pattern processing. Nevertheless, transient chemotopic maps may support neuronal computations by establishing important synaptic interactions within the circuit. These results provide insights into the functional topology of neural activity patterns and its potential role in circuit function.},

We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science.   Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

developed to render an arbitrary power potential cyclic. The resulting
Hamiltonian is analyzed as a quantum system to show its relation

to suppress ordering related terms in the transformed Hamiltonian
in the event that the classical canonical transformation leads to
a nonquadratic cyclic Hamiltonian. The associated anomalies are analyzed
to yield general methods to evaluate the path integral's prefactor

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

cancer before therapy and parallel tumor biopsies from 31 patients
two weeks after starting preoperative capecitabine chemoradiotherapy
were taken. The expression levels of single miRNA species were measured
using TaqMan Micro-RNA assays after reverse transcription from isolated
total RNAs. Many micro-RNAs (miR10a, miR21, miR145, miR212, miR339,
miR361) responded to chemoradiotherapy in individual tumor samples,
but there was profound intertumoral variability. However, other two
micro-RNAs miR125b, miR137 showed a significant increase in median
expression levels after starting therapy in most samples. Moreover,
our results for the first time show that higher induced levels of
miR125b and miR137 are associated with worse response to the therapy.},

abstract = {In young adult guinea pigs, the effects of unilateral cochlear ablation

were determined on the specific binding of [3H]strychnine measured

in subdivisions of the cochlear nucleus (CN), the superior olivary

complex, and the auditory midbrain, after 2, 7, 31, 60, and 147 postlesion

days. Changes in binding relative to that in age-matched controls

were interpreted as altered activity and/or expression of synaptic

glycine receptors. Postlesion binding declined ipsilaterally in most

of the ventral CN and in the lateral superior olive (LSO). Binding

was modestly deficient in the ipsilateral dorsal CN and in the anterior

part of the contralateral anteroventral CN. Binding was elevated

in the contralateral LSO. Transient changes also occurred. Binding

was elevated transiently, between 2 and 31 days, contralaterally

in parts of the anteroventral CN, bilaterally in the medial superior

olive (MSO), and bilaterally in most of the midbrain nuclei. Binding

was deficient transiently, at 60 days, in most of the contralateral

CN and bilaterally in the midbrain nuclei. The present findings,

together with previously reported postlesion changes in glycine release,

were consistent with persistently weakened glycinergic inhibitory

transmission ipsilaterally in the ventral CN and the LSO and bilaterally

in the dorsal CN. Glycinergic inhibitory transmission was strengthened

in the contralateral LSO and transiently strengthened in the MSO

bilaterally. A hypothetical model of the findings suggested that

glycine receptor regulation may depend on excitatory and glycinergic

input to auditory neurons. The present changes in glycine receptor

activity may contribute to altered auditory functions, which often

accompany hearing loss.},

abstract = {1. Digital imaging and photometry were used in conjunction with the

fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, Fura-2, to examine intracellular Ca2+

signals produced by depolarization of single adrenal chromaffin cells.

2. Depolarization with a patch pipette produced radial gradients

of Ca2+ within the cell, with Ca2+ concentration highest in the vicinity

of the plasma membrane. These gradients dissipated within a few hundred

milliseconds when the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were closed. 3.

Dialysis of Fura-2 into the chromaffin cell caused concentration-dependent

changes in the depolarization-induced Ca2+ signal, decreasing its

magnitude and slowing its recovery time course. These changes were

used to estimate the properties of the endogenous cytoplasmic Ca2+

buffer with which Fura-2 competes for Ca2+. 4. The spatially averaged

Fura-2 signal was well described by a model assuming fast competition

between Fura-2 and an endogenous buffer on a millisecond time scale.

Retrieval of calcium by pumps and slow buffers occurs on a seconds-long

time scale. No temporal changes indicative of buffers with intermediate

kinetics could be detected. 5. Two independent estimates of the capacity

of the fast endogenous Ca2+ buffer suggest that 98-99\% of the Ca2+

entering the cell normally is taken up by this buffer. This buffer

appears to be immobile, because it does not wash out of the cell

during dialysis. It has a low affinity for Ca2+ ions, because it

does not saturate with 1 microM-Ca2+ inside the cell. 6. The low

capacity, affinity and mobility of the endogenous Ca2+ buffer makes

it possible for relatively small amounts of exogenous Ca2+ buffers,

such as Fura-2, to exert a significant influence on the characteristics

of the Ca2+ concentration signal as measured by fluorescence ratios.

On the other hand, even at moderate Fura-2 concentrations (0.4 mM)

Fura-2 will dominate over the endogenous buffers. Under these conditions

radiometric Ca2+ concentration signals are largely attenuated, but

absolute fluorescence changes (at 390 nm) accurately reflect calcium

fluxes.},

abstract = {Pharmacological studies of the inferior colliculus (IC) suggest that

the inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid

(GABA) plays an important role in shaping responses to simple and

complex acoustic stimuli. Several models of auditory dysfunction,

including age-related hearing loss, tinnitus, and peripheral deafferentation,

suggest an alteration of normal GABA neurotransmission in central

auditory pathways. The present study attempts to further characterize

noise-induced changes in GABA markers in the IC. Four groups (unexposed

control, 0 h post-exposure, 42 h post-exposure, and 30 days post-exposure)

of 3-month-old male Fischer 344 rats were exposed to a high intensity

sound (12 kHz, 106 dB) for 10 h. Observed hair cell damage was primarily

confined to the basal half of the cochlea. There was a significant

decrease in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD(65)) immunoreactivity

in the IC membrane fraction compared to controls (P<0.05) at 0 h

(-41\%) and 42 h (-28\%) post-exposure, with complete recovery by

30 days post-exposure (P>0.98). Observed decreases in cytosolic levels

of GAD(65) were not significant. Quantitative muscimol receptor binding

revealed a significant increase (+20\%) in IC 30 days after sound

exposure (P<0.05). These data suggest that changes in GABA neurotransmission

occur in the IC of animals exposed to intense sound. Additional studies

are needed to determine whether these changes are a result of protective/compensatory

mechanisms or merely peripheral differentiation, as well as whether

these changes preserve or diminish central auditory system function.},

abstract = {Hippocampal place cells in the rat undergo experience-dependent changes when the rat runs stereotyped routes. One such change, the backward shift of the place field center of mass, has been linked by previous modeling efforts to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). However, these models did not account for the termination of the place field shift and they were based on an abstract implementation of STDP that ignores many of the features found in cortical plasticity. Here, instead of the abstract STDP model, we use a calcium-dependent plasticity (CaDP) learning rule that can account for many of the observed properties of cortical plasticity. We use the CaDP learning rule in combination with a model of metaplasticity to simulate place field dynamics. Without any major changes to the parameters of the original model, the present simulations account both for the initial rapid place field shift and for the subsequent slowing down of this shift. These results suggest that the CaDP model captures the essence of a general cortical mechanism of synaptic plasticity, which may underlie numerous forms of synaptic plasticity observed both in vivo and in vitro.},

using the Nauta-Rasmussen silver method, and related to hair cell

damage and to loss of myelinated nerve fibers in the osseous spiral

nucleus had already reached a peak by 16 days and disappeared after

1 month. Meanwhile, myelinated nerve fiber degeneration in the cochlea

extended basally, followed 2 weeks to 2 months later by spread of

axonal degeneration into the corresponding high-frequency region

of the ventral cochlear nucleus. Axonal degeneration occurred early

in the low-frequency region of the ventral cochlear nucleus, followed

2-4 weeks later by spread of myelinated fiber degeneration into more

apical regions of the cochlea. New degeneration of axons in the cochlear

nerve and in the ventral cochlear nucleus continued to occur for

up to 8 months after stimulation. These findings imply that plastic

changes in the central auditory pathways could play a role in the

long-term effects of cochlear damage and acoustic overstimulation,

possibly leading to a chronic neurodegenerative condition in the

This property may be essential in networks where appropriate response to environmental change is critical and may, in such systems, be more important than features, such as connectivity, often used to characterize network topologies.

We approximate the matrix X as circumflexX = sigma(k=1)(K) d(k)u(k)v(k)(T), where d(k), u(k), and v(k) minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X - circumflexX, subject to penalties on u(k) and v(k). This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L(1)-penalties on u(k) and v(k), which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the PMD is applied using an L(1)-penalty on v(k) but not on u(k), a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the "SCoTLASS" proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply this penalized CCA method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and DNA copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

abstract = {Cochlear damage can change the spontaneous firing rates of neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Increased spontaneous firing rates (hyperactivity) after acoustic trauma have been observed in the DCN of rodents such as hamsters, chinchillas and rats. This hyperactivity has been interpreted as a neural correlate of tinnitus. In cats, however, the spontaneous firing rates of DCN neurons were not significantly elevated after acoustic trauma. Species-specific spontaneous firing rates after cochlear damage might be attributable to differences in the response types of DCN neurons: In gerbils, type III response characteristics are predominant, whereas in cats type IV responses are more frequent. To address the question of how the development of hyperactivity after cochlear damage depends on the response type of DCN neurons, we use a computational model of the basic circuit of the DCN. By changing the strength of two types of inhibition, we can reproduce salient features of the responses of DCN neurons. Simulated cochlear damage, which decreases the activity of auditory nerve fibers, is assumed to activate homeostatic plasticity in projection neurons (PNs) of the DCN. We find that the resulting spontaneous firing rates depend on the response type of DCN PNs: PNs with type III and type IV-T response characteristics may become hyperactive, whereas type IV PNs do not develop increased spontaneous firing rates after acoustic trauma. This theoretical framework for the mechanisms and circumstances of the development of hyperactivity in central auditory neurons might also provide new insights into the development of tinnitus.},

These techniques rely mainly on organic-chemistry-based dyes as indicators of Ca(2+) and membrane potential. However, recently a new generation of probes, genetically encoded fluorescent protein sensors, has emerged for use by physiologists studying the operation of neuronal circuits. We critically review the development of these new probes, and analyze objectives and experimental conditions in which classical probes are likely to prevail and where the fluorescent protein sensors will open paths to previously unexplored territories of functional neuroimaging.},

@article{LeakeVollmer00,
abstract = {The goal of this research is to examine the functional consequences

of patterned electrical stimulation delivered by a cochlear implant

in the deafened developing auditory system. In previous electrophysiological

experiments conducted in the inferior colliculus (IC), we have demonstrated

that the precise cochleotopic organization of the central nucleus

(ICC) develops normally in neonatally deafened unstimulated cats

and is unaltered despite the lack of normal auditory input during

development. However, these studies also showed that chronic electrical

stimulation delivered at a single intracochlear location by one bipolar

channel of a cochlear implant induces significant expansion of the

central representation of the stimulated cochlear sector and degrades

the cochleotopic organization of the IC. This report presents additional

data from a new experimental series of neonatally deafened cats that

received chronic stimulation on two adjacent bipolar intracochlear

channels of a cochlear implant. Results suggest that competing inputs

elicited by electrical stimulation delivered by two adjacent channels

can maintain the selective representations of each activated cochlear

sector within the central auditory system and prevent the expansion

seen after single-channel stimulation. Alternating stimulation of

two channels and use of highly controlled electrical signals may

be particularly effective in maintaining or even sharpening selectivity

of central representations of stimulated cochlear sectors. In contrast,

simultaneous stimulation using two channels of a model analog cochlear

implant processor in one experimental animal failed to maintain channel

selectivity and resulted in marked expansion and fusion of the central

representations of the stimulated channels. This potentially important

preliminary result suggests that under some conditions the central

auditory system may be unable to discriminate simultaneous, overlapping

inputs from adjacent cochlear implant channels as distinct.},

The domain has been parcellated in seven subdivisions which, in spite of some species' differences, are easily identifiable in all of the included animals. The cochlear granule cells are considered as a particular class of neuron, which is slightly different from, but nevertheless principally similar to the cerebellar granule cells in both shape and mode of neuronal connections. The digitiform terminals of the cochlear granule cells differentiate after the first two weeks of extrauterine life. In several respects these cells show larger variation among species than do the cerebellar granules, the similarity between the two classes of granule cells being most conspicuous in the rodent. The silver, Golgi rapid, and HRP material suggest that all, or at least the majority, of the granule cell axons project to the molecular layer of the DCN, forming parallel fibers similar to those of the cerebellar cortex. Also, the cochlear parallel fibers traverse the spiny apical dendrites of principal neurons (the pyramidal cells) and the smoother dendrites of molecular layer stellate cells.},

@article{Singh2005,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach to edge detection. We see
edges as delineators of local, photometrically coherent clusters
of pixels. We are concerned with edges at a given pair of photometric
and spatial scales. We first define the Similarity Region (SR) of
a pixel as the set of pixels in it's neighborhood that form a local
cluster with the pixel. The SR is discovered by using an affinity
measure at the given spatial and photometric scales. It follows then
that the SR's for two adjacent pixels within a region will be similar
and they will be different for pixels across a region boundary. This
property is used to determine if there is an edge between any two
pixels. SR's of a pixel pair are evaluated for similarity in two
ways - by comparing their geometric properties and by comparing the
affinity distributions of pixels within them. This leads to two edge
operators. The first uses Normalized difference of Moments (NdM)
of the two SR's, while the second uses a $\chi$\^{}2-measure of the two
affinity distributions. These edge operators are fast, they respond
to local edge freatures like corners faithfully and they do not introduce
bias or localization errors for images with ESNR (Edge Strength to
Noise Ratio) greater than 10dB. For higher noise, the methods respond
to edges of regions formed by noise. For robustness, we propose a
preprocessing step that clusters data. To this end, we present two
clustering algorithms based on cost function optimization. The first
algorithm is an Iterated Mode algorithm that uses the histogram of
pixel values in a local window to replace each pixel value with a
value that has higher probability of occurrence at that pixel. The
second algoruthm minimizes a Soft Clustering Evaluation Function
(SCEF) to partition the image into clusters such that the mutual
information between these clusters is minimized. This work is closely
related to Rosenfeld et al.'s iterative smoothing algoruthms, histogram-based
techniques and pyramid linking shcmes; these relationships are pointed
out. We present the responses of edge operators on synthetic and
real images. The integration of these operators to define coherent
edge detectors will be reported in the near future.},

abstract = {Dendritic spikes that propagate toward the soma are well documented, but their physiological role remains uncertain. Our in vitro patch-clamp recordings and two-photon calcium imaging show that direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) utilize orthograde dendritic spikes during physiological activity. DSGCs signal the direction of image motion. Excitatory subthreshold postsynaptic potentials are observed in DSGCs for motion in all directions and provide a weakly tuned directional signal. However, spikes are generated over only a narrow range of motion angles, indicating that spike generation greatly enhances directional tuning. Our results indicate that spikes are initiated at multiple sites within the dendritic arbors of DSGCs and that each dendritic spike initiates a somatic spike. We propose that dendritic spike failure, produced by local inhibitory inputs, might be a critical factor that enhances directional tuning of somatic spikes.},

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

@article{Davis2000,
abstract = {The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is rich in both glycine and GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter systems, and the response properties of its principal cells (pyramidal and giant cells) are strongly shaped by inhibitory inputs. For example, DCN principal cells often display highly nonmonotonic (so-called type IV) input-output functions in response to best-frequency (BF) tones. In this study, the inhibitory inputs onto the principal cell types and onto response types of known inhibitory interneurons were compared before and during iontophoretic application of the glycine- and GABA(A)-receptor antagonists, strychnine and bicuculline. Strychnine eliminates the central (on-BF) inhibitory area in type IV units, resulting in monotonic BF rate-level curves. Unexpectedly, bicuculline primarily enhances inhibition in principal-cell types; for example, type IV units are inhibited at lower sound levels in the presence of bicuculline. Principal cell types with weaker inhibitory inputs (type IV-T and type III units) are more strongly inhibited in the presence of bicuculline and usually are converted into type IV units. This enhancement of on-BF inhibition by bicuculline suggests a disinhibitory process involving GABA(A) action on a non-GABA(A)ergic inhibitory pathway. This latter pathway is probably glycinergic and involves type II units (deep-layer vertical cells) and/or complex-spiking units (superficial cartwheel cells) because both of these unit types are disinhibited by bicuculline. One intrinsic GABA(A) source could be the superficial stellate cells in DCN because bicuculline partly blocks the inhibition evoked by somatosensory-stimulated activation of the superficial granule-cell circuitry in DCN. Taken together, the results suggest that glycinergic circuits mediate directly the inhibition of DCN principal cells, but that GABA(A)ergic circuits modulate the strength of the inhibition.},

abstract = {The intracellular events on the recycling pathway that lead from sorting endosomes to exocytosis at the plasma membrane are central to cellular function. However, despite intensive study, these processes are poorly characterized in spatial and dynamic terms. The primary reason for this is that, to date, it has not been possible to visualize rapidly moving intracellular compartments in three dimensions in cells. Here, we use a recently developed imaging setup in which multiple planes can be simultaneously imaged within the cell in conjunction with visualization of the plasma membrane plane by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This has allowed us to track and characterize intracellular events on the recycling pathway that lead to exocytosis of the MHC Class I-related receptor, FcRn. We observe both direct delivery of tubular and vesicular transport containers (TCs) from sorting endosomes to exocytic sites at the plasma membrane, and indirect pathways in which TCs that are not in proximity to sorting endosomes undergo exocytosis. TCs can also interact with different sorting endosomes before exocytosis. Our data provide insight into the intracellular events that precede exocytic fusion.},

abstract = {The structure of local synaptic circuits is the key to understanding cortical function and how neuronal functional modules such as cortical columns are formed. The central problem in deciphering cortical microcircuits is the quantification of synaptic connectivity between neuron pairs. I present a theoretical model that accounts for the axon and dendrite morphologies of pre- and postsynaptic cells and provides the average number of synaptic contacts formed between them as a function of their relative locations in three-dimensional space. An important aspect of the current approach is the representation of a complex structure of an axonal/dendritic arbor as a superposition of basic structures-synaptic clouds. Each cloud has three structural parameters that can be directly estimated from two-dimensional drawings of the underlying arbor. Using empirical data available in literature, I applied this theory to three morphologically different types of cell pairs. I found that, within a wide range of cell separations, the theory is in very good agreement with empirical data on (i) axonal-dendritic contacts of pyramidal cells and (ii) somatic synapses formed by the axons of inhibitory interneurons. Since for many types of neurons plane arborization drawings are available from literature, this theory can provide a practical means for quantitatively deriving local synaptic circuits based on the actual observed densities of specific types of neurons and their morphologies. It can also have significant implications for computational models of cortical networks by making it possible to wire up simulated neural networks in a realistic fashion.},

First, theoretical considerations show why and under what conditions diffusion contrast is positive. Using this result, spin displacement spectra that are conventionally phase-encoded can be accurately reconstructed by a Fourier transform of the measured signal's modulus. Second, studies of in vitro and in vivo samples demonstrate correspondence between the orientational maxima of the diffusion spectrum and those of the fiber orientation density at each location. In specimens with complex muscular tissue, such as the tongue, diffusion spectrum images show characteristic local heterogeneities of fiber architectures, including angular dispersion and intersection. Cerebral diffusion spectra acquired in normal human subjects resolve known white matter tracts and tract intersections. Finally, the relation between the presented model-free imaging technique and other available diffusion MRI schemes is discussed.},

abstract = {Most excitatory synaptic connections occur on dendritic spines. Calcium

imaging experiments have suggested that spines constitute individual

calcium compartments, but recent results have challenged this idea.

Using two-photon microscopy to image fluorescence with high resolution

in strongly scattering tissue, we measured calcium dynamics in spines

from CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices of rat hippocampus. Subthreshold

synaptic stimulation and spontaneous synaptic events produced calcium

accumulations that were localized to isolated spines, showed stochastic

failure, and were abolished by postsynaptic blockers. Single somatic

spikes induced fast-peaking calcium accumulation in spines throughout

the cell. Pairing of spikes with synaptic stimulation was frequently

cooperative, that is, it resulted in supralinear calcium accumulations.

We conclude: (1) calcium channels exist in spine heads; (2) action

potentials invade the spines; (3) spines are individual calcium compartments;

and (4) spines can individually detect the temporal coincidence of

pre- and postsynaptic activity, and thus serve as basic functional

units of neuronal integration.},

@article{Gutenkunst2007,
abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

As a first example, neuronal pathways in the rat brain were probed. Eight well-known fiber projections; genu and splenium of corpus callosum, internal and external capsule, fimbria, anterior commissure, optic tract, and stria terminalis were tracked and shown to be in agreement with the location of these known axonal projections. The experiment took 2 hr and shorter times should be possible in the clinical situation. By combining anisotropy information with fiber tracking, the anisotropy of individual projections was also documented. Magn Reson Med 42:1123-1127, 1999.},

abstract = {The distribution and colocalization of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and glycine-like immunoreactivity in the cochlear nuclear complex of the guinea pig have been studied to produce a light microscopic atlas. The method used was based on post-embedding immunocytochemistry in pairs of 0.5-micron-thick plastic sections treated with polyclonal antibodies against conjugated GABA and glycine respectively. Immunoreactive cells, presumably short axon neurones, predominated in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, with mostly single-GABA-labelled cells in the superficial layer, double-labelled in the middle, and single-glycine-labelled in the deep layers. A few large single-glycine-labelled cells, interpreted as commissural neurons, occurred in the ventral nucleus. Scattered double-labelled cells, probably Golgi cells, were seen in the granule cell domain. Immunolabeled puncta of all three staining categories occurred in large numbers throughout the complex, apposed to somata and in the neuropil, showing a differential distribution onto different types of neuron. Three immunolabeled tracts were noted: the tuberculoventral tract, the commissural acoustic stria, and the trapezoidal descending fibres. Most of the fibres in these tracts were single-labelled for glycine, although in the last mentioned tract single-GABA- and double-labelled fibres were also found. Some of the immunolabeled cell types described here are proposed as the origins of the similarly labelled puncta and fibres on the basis of known intrinsic connections.},

We found that vPFC neurons were modulated significantly by both the spatial and nonspatial attributes of an auditory stimulus. When comparing these responses with those in anterolateral belt region of the auditory cortex, which is hypothesized to be specialized for processing the nonspatial attributes of auditory stimuli, we found that the nonspatial sensitivity of vPFC neurons was poorer, whereas the spatial selectivity was better than anterolateral neurons. Also, the spatial and nonspatial sensitivity of vPFC neurons was comparable with that seen in the lateral intraparietal area, a cortical area that is a part of the dorsal pathway.

To overcome these spatiotemporal limitations, we develop an addressable confocal microscope that permits concurrent optical recordings from multiple user-selected sites of interest at high frame rates. Our system utilizes acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) for rapid positioning of a focused laser beam and a digital micromirror device (DMD) for addressable spatial filtering to achieve confocality. A registration algorithm synchronizes the AODs and DMD such that point illumination and point detection are always colocalized in conjugate image planes. The current system has an adjustable spatial resolution of approximately 0.5 to 1 microm. Furthermore, we show that recordings can be made at an aggregate frame rate of approximately 40 kHz. The system is capable of optical sectioning; this property is used to create 3-D reconstructions of fluorescently labeled test specimens and visualize neurons in brain slices. Additionally, we use the system to record intracellular calcium transients at several sites in hippocampal neurons using the fluorescent calcium indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1.},

Receptive fields are thought to provide a representation of sensory experience from which the cerebral cortex may make interpretations. While it is essential to determine a neuron's receptive field, it remains unclear which features of the acoustic environment are specifically represented by neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI). We characterized cat AI spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) by finding both the spike-triggered average (STA) and stimulus dimensions that maximized the mutual information between response and stimulus. We derived a nonlinearity relating spiking to stimulus projection onto two maximally informative dimensions (MIDs). The STA was highly correlated with the first MID. Generally, the nonlinearity for the first MID was asymmetric and often monotonic in shape, while the second MID nonlinearity was symmetric and nonmonotonic. The joint nonlinearity for both MIDs revealed that most first and second MIDs were synergistic and thus should be considered conjointly. The difference between the nonlinearities suggests different possible roles for the MIDs in auditory processing.},

Segmentation of the subvolumes into cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and white matter tissue is validated by comparison with manual segmentation. When compared with other segmentation methods that use traditional Bayesian segmentation, AKM yields smaller errors (P < .005, exact Wilcoxon signed rank test) demonstrating the robustness and wide applicability of AKM across different structures. By generating multiple mixtures for each tissue compartment, AKM mimics the increased variation of manual segmentation in partial volumes due to the highly folded tissues. AKM's superior performance makes it useful for tissue segmentation of subcortical and cortical structures in large-scale neuroimaging studies.},

abstract = {Understanding neural responses with natural stimuli has increasingly become an essential part of characterizing neural coding. Neural responses are commonly characterized by a linear-nonlinear (LN) model, in which the output of a linear filter applied to the stimulus is transformed by a static nonlinearity to determine neural response. To estimate the linear filter in the LN model, studies of responses to natural stimuli commonly use methods that are unbiased only for a linear model (in which there is no static nonlinearity): spike-triggered averages with correction for stimulus power spectrum, with or without regularization. Although these methods work well for artificial stimuli, such as Gaussian white noise, we show here that they estimate neural filters of LN models from responses to natural stimuli much more poorly. We studied simple cells in cat primary visual cortex. We demonstrate that the filters computed by directly taking the nonlinearity into account have better predictive power and depend less on the stimulus than those computed under the linear model. With noise stimuli, filters computed using the linear and LN models were similar, as predicted theoretically. With natural stimuli, filters of the two models can differ profoundly. Noise and natural stimulus filters differed significantly in spatial properties, but these differences were exaggerated when filters were computed using the linear rather than the LN model. Although regularization of filters computed under the linear model improved their predictive power, it also led to systematic distortions of their spatial frequency profiles, especially at low spatial and temporal frequencies.},

abstract = {Five parameters of one of the most common neuronal models, the diffusion leaky integrate-and-fire model, also known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck neuronal model, were estimated on the basis of intracellular recording. These parameters can be classified into two categories. Three of them (the membrane time constant, the resting potential and the firing threshold) characterize the neuron itself. The remaining two characterize the neuronal input. The intracellular data were collected during spontaneous firing, which in this case is characterized by a Poisson process of interspike intervals. Two methods for the estimation were applied, the regression method and the maximum-likelihood method. Both methods permit to estimate the input parameters and the membrane time constant in a short time window (a single interspike interval). We found that, at least in our example, the regression method gave more consistent results than the maximum-likelihood method. The estimates of the input parameters show the asymptotical normality, which can be further used for statistical testing, under the condition that the data are collected in different experimental situations. The model neuron, as deduced from the determined parameters, works in a subthreshold regimen. This result was confirmed by both applied methods. The subthreshold regimen for this model is characterized by the Poissonian firing. This is in a complete agreement with the observed interspike interval data.},

abstract = {Our brains allow us to reason about alternatives and to make choices that are likely to pay off. Often there is no one correct answer, but instead one that is favoured simply because it is more likely to lead to reward. A variety of probabilistic classification tasks probe the covert strategies that humans use to decide among alternatives based on evidence that bears only probabilistically on outcome. Here we show that rhesus monkeys can also achieve such reasoning. We have trained two monkeys to choose between a pair of coloured targets after viewing four shapes, shown sequentially, that governed the probability that one of the targets would furnish reward. Monkeys learned to combine probabilistic information from the shape combinations. Moreover, neurons in the parietal cortex reveal the addition and subtraction of probabilistic quantities that underlie decision-making on this task.},

abstract = {Neural networks are composed of basic units somewhat analogous to
neurons. These units are linked to each other by connections whose
strength is modifiable as a result of a learning process or algorithm.
Each of these units integrates independently (in parallel) the information
provided by its synapses in order to evaluate its state of activation.
The unit response is then a linear or nonlinear function of its activation.
Linear algebra concepts are used, in general, to analyze linear units,
with eigenvectirs and eigenvalues being the core concepts involved.
This analysis makes clear the strong similarite between linear neural
networks and the general linear model developed by statisticians.
The linar models presented here are the perceptron, and the linear
associator. The behavior of nonlinear networks can be described within
the framework of optimization and approximation techniques with dynamical
systems (e.g., like those used to model spin glasses). One of the
main notions used with nonlinear unit networks is the notioon of
attractor. When the task of the network is to associate a response
with some specific input patterns, the most popular nonlinear technique
consists of using hidden layers of neurons trained with back-propagation
of error. The nonlinear models presented are the Hopfield network,
the Boltzmann machine, the back-propagation network, and the radial
basis function network.},

But the term "organic" signifying the processes inside the body, is inadequate to express the characteristic of human mind. The recent philosophy of mind suggests that the mind is realized neither only in the brain nor only in the body, but in the whole system of brain-body-environment, namely, in the "extended mind". The characteristic of human mind resides in the interaction with the mediating tools, artifacts, and the humanized environment.

abstract = {Most currently available confocal or two-photon laser scanning microscopes (LSMs) allow acquisition rates of the order of 1-5 images s(-1), which is too slow to fully resolve dynamic changes in intracellular messenger concentration in living cells or tissues. Several technologies exist to obtain faster imaging rates, either in the video-rate range (30 images s(-1)) or beyond, but the most versatile technology available today is based on resonant scanners for horizontal line scanning. These scanning devices have several advantages over designs based on acousto-optical deflectors or Nipkow discs, but a drawback is that the scanning pattern is not a linear but rather a sinusoidal function of time. This puts additional constraints on the hardware necessary to read-in the image data flow, one of which is the generation of a pixel clock that varies in frequency with the position of the pixel on the scanned line. We describe a practical solution to obtain a variable pixel clock add-on that is easy to build and is easy to integrate into a custom-built LSM based on resonant scanning technology. In addition, we discuss some important hardware and software design aspects that simplify the construction of a resonant scanning-based LSM for high-speed, high-resolution imaging. Finally, we demonstrate that the microscope can be used to resolve calcium puffs triggered by photolytically increasing the intracellular concentration of inositol trisphosphate.},

It is well known, however, that synapses are highly dynamic and show use-dependent plasticity over a wide range of time scales. Moreover, synaptic transmission is an inherently stochastic process: a spike arriving at a presynaptic terminal triggers the release of a vesicle of neurotransmitter from a release site with a probability that can be much less than one. We consider a simple model for dynamic stochastic synapses that can easily be integrated into common models for networks of integrate-and-fire neurons (spiking neurons). The parameters of this model have direct interpretations in terms of synaptic physiology. We investigate the consequences of the model for computing with individual spikes and demonstrate through rigorous theoretical results that the computational power of the network is increased through the use of dynamic synapses.},

O2 to produce O3 + O, and 3) each O atom recombines with O2 to form
O3. The overall reaction scheme, O3 + hn + 3O2 \^{A}® 3O3, produces more
ozone than it consumes. The dissociation channel which begins this
scheme is more probable for heavy ozone than for 48O3 and one of
the oxygen atoms in the original O3 is encorporated into a new O3.
Thus, this new ozone source tends to "distill" heavy oxygen atoms
into the O3 pool while depleting them from the O2 pool. The amount
of enrichment produced by this mechanism, while significant, is still
too small to account for the large observed stratospheric enrichment
of heavy ozone.},

abstract = {The zebrafish model system is ideal for studying nervous system development.
Ultimately, one would like to link the developmental biology to various
aspects of behavior. We are studying the consequences of nicotine
exposure on nervous system development in zebrafish and have previously
shown that chronic nicotine exposure produces paralysis. We also
have made observations that the embryos moved in the initial minutes
of the exposure as the bend rates of the musculature increased. This
nicotine induced behavior manifests as an increase in the rate of
spinal musculature bends, which spontaneously begin at approximately
17 h post fertilization. The behavioral observations prompted the
systematic characterization of nicotine-induced modulation of zebrafish
embryonic motor output; bends of the trunk musculature. We first
characterized embryonic motor output in zebrafish embryos with and
without their chorions. We then characterized the motor output in
embryos raised at 28 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The act of dechorionation
along with temperature influenced the embryonic bend rate. We show
that nicotine exposure increases embryonic motor output. Nicotine
exposure caused the musculature bends to alternate in a left-right-left
fashion. Nicotine was able to produce this phenotype in embryos lacking
supraspinal input. We then characterize the kinetics of nicotine
influx and efflux and demonstrate that nicotine as low as 1 muM can
disrupt embryonic physiology. Taken together, these results indicate
the presence of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) associated
with embryonic spinal motor circuits early in embryogenesis.},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

92: 780\^{A}–789, 2004; 10.1152/jn.01171.2003. Recent studies have revealed
striking precision in the spike trains of retinal ganglion cells
in several species and suggested that this precision could be an
important aspect of visual signaling. However, the precision of spike
trains has not yet been described in primate retina. The spike time
and count variability of parasol (magnocellular-projecting) retinal
ganglion cells was examined in isolated macaque monkey retinas stimulated
with repeated presentations of high contrast, spatially uniform intensity
modulation. At the onset of clearly delineated periods of firing,
retinal ganglion cells fired spikes time-locked to the stimulus with
a variability across trials as low as 1 ms. Spike count variance
across trials was much lower than the mean and sometimes approached
the minimum variance possible with discrete counts, inconsistent
with Poisson statistics expected from independently generated spikes.
Spike time and count variability decreased systematically with stimulus
strength. These findings were consistent with a model in which firing
probability was determined by a stimulus-driven free firing rate
modulated by a recovery function representing the action potential
absolute and relative refractory period.},

is highly useful in various applications including image enhancement
for digital cameras, target recognition, image indexing for content-based
retrieval, and 3D microscopic image analysis. This paper describes
a novel multiresolution image segmentation algorithm for low DOF
images. The algorithm is designed to separate a sharply focused object-of-interest
from other foreground or background objects. The algorithm is fully
automatic in that all parameters are image independent. A multiscale
approach based on high frequency wavelet coefficients and their statistics
is used to perform context-dependent classification of individual
blocks of the image. Unlike other edge-based approaches, our algorithm
does not rely on the process of connecting object boundaries. The
algorithm has achieved high accuracy when tested on more than 100
low DOF images, many with inhomogeneous foreground or background
distractions. Compared with the state of the art algorithms, this
new algorithm provides better accuracy at higher speed.},

These efforts have been motivated by the belief that similar synaptic modifications occur during memory formation, but it has never been shown that learning actually induces LTP in CA1. We found that one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning in rats produced the same changes in hippocampal glutamate receptors as induction of LTP with HFS and caused a spatially restricted increase in the amplitude of evoked synaptic transmission in CA1 in vivo. Because the learning-induced synaptic potentiation occluded HFS-induced LTP, we conclude that inhibitory avoidance training induces LTP in CA1.},

altered [Ca2+]i almost exclusively via the NMDA receptor. Furthermore,
synaptically induced Ca2+ entry relied almost completely on NMDA
receptor activation, even with low-frequency stimulation. The inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA also increased [Ca2+]i, probably via voltage-sensitive
Ca2+ channels, whereas the neuromodulator acetylcholine caused Ca2+
release from intracellular stores via a muscarinic receptor. Low
concentrations of these agonists produced nonperiodic [Ca2+]i oscillations,
which were temporally correlated in neighbouring cells. Optical recording

have revealed both pre- and postsynaptic effects. Understanding the
extent to which individual presynaptic axonal boutons could provide
local compartments for control of synaptic efficacy and microconnectivity
requires knowledge of their three-dimensional morphology and composition.
In hippocampal slices, serial electron microscopy was used to examine
a nearly homogeneous population of CA3-->CA1 axons in the middle
of stratum radiatum of area CA1. The locations of postsynaptic densities
(PSDs), vesicles, and mitochondria were determined along 75 axon
segments (9.1 +/- 2.0 micrometer in length). Synapses, defined by
the colocalization of PSDs and vesicles, occurred on average at 2.7
micrometer intervals along the axons. Most varicosities (68\%) had
one PSD, 19\% had 2-4 PSDs, and 13\% had none. Synaptic vesicles occurred
in 90\% of the varicosities. One-half (53\%) of the varicosities lacked
mitochondria, raising questions about their regulation of ATP and
Ca2+, and 8\% of varicosities contained only mitochondria. Eleven
axons were reconstructed fully. The varicosities were oblong and
varied greatly in both length (1.1 +/- 0.7 micrometer) and volume
(0.13 +/- 0.14 micrometer 3), whereas the intervaricosity shafts
were narrow, tubular, and similar in diameter (0.17 +/- 0.04 micrometer)
but variable in length (1.4 +/- 1.2 micrometer). The narrow axonal
shafts resemble dendritic spine necks and thus could promote biochemical
compartmentalization of individual axonal varicosities. The findings
raise the intriguing possibility of localized differences in metabolism
and connectivity among different axons, varicosities, and synapses.},

Yet, memory depends on synaptic protein receptors that are recycled in and out of the membrane at a fast rate, possibly several times an hour. Several proposals to bridge this vast gap in time scales between memory and its molecular substrate have relied on bistable molecular switches. Here, we propose an alternative to this approach based on clusters of interacting receptors in the synaptic membrane. We show that such clusters can be metastable and that the lifetime of such clusters can be many orders of magnitude larger than the lifetime of the receptors of which they are composed. We also demonstrate how bidirectional synaptic plasticity can be implemented in this framework.},

We proceed to develop a theory of Bayesian learning in spiking neural networks, where the neurons learn to recognize temporal dynamics of their synaptic inputs. Meanwhile, successive layers of neurons learn hierarchical causal models for the sensory input. The corresponding learning rule is local, spike-time dependent, and highly nonlinear. This approach provides a principled description of spiking and plasticity rules maximizing information transfer, while limiting the number of costly spikes, between successive layers of neurons.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can reveal detailed white matter anatomy and has the potential to detect abnormalities in specific white matter structures. Such detection and quantification are, however, not straightforward. The voxel-based analysis after image normalization is one of the most widely used methods for quantitative image analyses. To apply this approach to DTI, it is important to examine if structures in the white matter are well registered among subjects, which would be highly dependent on employed algorithms for normalization. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of normalization of DTI data using a highly elastic transformation algorithm, called large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping. After simulation-based validation of the algorithm, DTI data from normal subjects were used to measure the registration accuracy. To examine the impact of morphological abnormalities on the accuracy, the algorithm was also tested using data from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with severe brain atrophy. The accuracy level was measured by using manual landmark-based white matter matching and surface-based brain and ventricle matching as gold standard. To improve the accuracy level, cascading and multi-contrast approaches were developed. The accuracy level for the white matter was 1.88+/-0.55 and 2.19+/-0.84 mm for the measured locations in the controls and patients, respectively.},

abstract = {Although the addition of just the excitation light field at the focus, or of just the fluorescence field at the detector is sufficient for a three- to fivefold resolution increase in 4Pi-fluorescence microscopy, substantial improvements of its optical properties are achieved by exploiting both effects simultaneously. They encompass not only an additional expansion of the optical bandwidth, but also an amplified transfer of the newly gained spatial frequencies to the image. Here we report on the realization and the imaging properties of this 4Pi microscopy mode of type C that also is the far-field microscope with the hitherto largest aperture. We show that in conjunction with two-photon excitation, the resulting optical transfer function displays a sevenfold improvement of axial three-dimensional resolution over confocal microscopy in aqueous samples, and more importantly, a marked transfer of all frequencies within its inner region of support. The latter is present also without the confocal pinhole. Thus, linear image deconvolution is possible both for confocalized and nonconfocalized live-cell 4Pi imaging. Realized in a state-of-the-art scanning microscope, this approach enables robust three-dimensional imaging of fixed and live cells at approximately 80 nm axial resolution.},

abstract = {Epidemiology as defined by Last is "the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations and the application of this study to the prevention and control of health problems". Traditional epidemiological studies include quantitative and qualitative study designs. Quantitative study designs include observational and interventional methodology. Observational methods describe associations that are already present at population (descriptive) or individual (analytical) level. Although they form the mainstay of epidemiological studies, observational methods are prone to bias and confounding. These can be dealt with by various means involving both the study design and statistical analysis. Interventional methods involve changing variables in one or more groups of people and comparing outcomes between those with the changed and unchanged variable. Interventional studies can more readily account for bias (such as through randomisation) and confounding (such as through controlling) as is seen in randomised, controlled trials. Qualitative studies employ non-numeric methods to obtain "richer" information on how people perceive or experience situations. Much of epidemiology and epidemiological methods have been stable for many years. There are, however, emerging issues in epidemiology, including those of causal inference, counterfactuals and Mendelian randomisation, among others. There are also several modern and emerging uses of traditional epidemiological techniques in the fields of infectious disease, environmental, molecular and genetic epidemiology.},

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins (FPs) based on green fluorescent protein (GFP) are widely used throughout cell biology to study protein dynamics, and have extensive use as reporters of virus infection and spread. However, FP-tagging of viruses is limited by the constraints of viral genome size resulting in FP loss through recombination events. To overcome this, we have engineered a smaller ( approximately 10 kDa) flavin-based alternative to GFP ( approximately 25 kDa) derived from the light, oxygen or voltage-sensing (LOV) domain of the plant blue light receptor, phototropin. Molecular evolution and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based expression screening produced LOV variants with improved fluorescence and photostability in planta. One variant in particular, designated iLOV, possessed photophysical properties that made it ideally suited as a reporter of subcellular protein localization in both plant and mammalian cells. Moreover, iLOV fluorescence was found to recover spontaneously after photobleaching and displayed an intrinsic photochemistry conferring advantages over GFP-based FPs. When expressed either as a cytosolic protein or as a viral protein fusion, iLOV functioned as a superior reporter to GFP for monitoring local and systemic infections of plant RNA viruses. iLOV, therefore, offers greater utility in FP-tagging of viral gene products and represents a viable alternative where functional protein expression is limited by steric constraints or genome size.},

abstract = {Chinchillas are notable for a low-frequency hearing range similar

to that of humans and a marked sensitivity to loud noise. A single

noise exposure that produces cochlear damage may lead to progressive

loss of synaptic endings in the cochlear nucleus, followed by new

axonal growth. As an index of synaptic regulation during such changes,

we have examined the expression of a synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin,

in the cochlear nucleus following a damaging acoustic stimulus in

adult chinchillas. With one ear protected by a plug, following a

3-h exposure to an octave-band noise of 108 dB sound pressure level,

centered at 4 kHz, the unprotected cochlea and the cochlear nuclei

exhibited degeneration of hair cells and axons over periods of 7,

14, 30, 90, and 150 days. Axonal degeneration, as revealed by a silver

degeneration method, was heavy ipsilateral to the cochlear damage,

but sparse degeneration also appeared on the contralateral, unexposed

side. Synaptophysin immunostaining underwent a major, bilateral decline

in the anteroventral and posteroventral cochlear nuclei, interrupted

at intervening periods by transient increases in the numbers of stained

structures. A distinction in staining between large perisomatic structures

and smaller puncta in the neuropil and between the dorsal and the

ventral zones of the ventral cochlear nuclei revealed some variations

in the response and degree of recovery of synaptophysin staining.

These findings could best be explained by degeneration of synaptic

endings followed by new growth of terminals and by regulatory changes

in the levels of synaptophysin expression and synaptic vesicle accumulation

over time.},

abstract = {Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly before a postsynaptic neuron and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron's response variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron's output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an objective function that minimizes response variability and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena, including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic efficacy increases. We compare our account to other efforts to derive STDP from computational principles and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of unsupervised cortical adaptation.},

One of such tasks is the motility analysis of the multiple subcellular structures. In this paper, an algorithm using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method for multiple interacting object tracking is proposed. We use joint state to represent all the objects together, and model the interaction between objects in the 2D plane by augmenting an extra dimension and evaluating their overlapping relationship in the 3D space. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with a novel height swap move is applied to sample the joint state distribution efficiently. To facilitate distinguishing between different objects, a new observation method is also proposed by matching the size and intensity profile of the object. The experimental results show that our method is promising.},

@article{Routtenberg2008,
abstract = {Current models of memory typically require a protein synthetic step leading to a more or less permanent structural change in synapses of the network that represent the stored information. This instructive role of protein synthesis has recently been called into question [Routtenberg, A., Rekart, J.L. 2005. Post-translational modification of synaptic proteins as the substrate for long-lasting memory. Trends Neurosci. 28, 12-19]. In its place a new theory is proposed in which post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins already synthesized and present within the synapse calibrate synaptic strength. PTM is thus the only mechanism required to sustain long-lasting memories. Activity-induced, PTM-dependent structural modifications within brain synapses then define network formation which is thus a product of the concatenation of cascaded PTMs. This leads to a formulation different from current protein synthesis models in which neural networks initially formed from these individual synaptic PTM-dependent changes is maintained by regulated positive feedback maintains. One such positive feedback mechanism is 'cryptic rehearsal' typically referred to as 'noise' or 'spontaneous' activity. This activity is in fact not random or spontaneous but determined in a stochastic sense by the past history of activation of the nerve cell. To prevent promiscuous network formation, the regulated positive feedback maintains the altered state given specific decay kinetics for the PTM. The up or down state of individual synapses actually exists in an infinite number of intermediate states, never fully 'up', nor fully 'down.' The networks formed from these uncertain synapses are therefore metastable. A particular memory is also multiply represented by a 'degenerate code' so that should loss of a subset of representations occur, erasure can be protected against. This mechanism also solves the flexibility-stability problem by positing that the brain eschews synaptic stability having its own uncertainty principle that allows retrieval from a probabilistic network, so that a retrieved memory can be represented by a selection of components from an essentially infinite number of networks. The network so formed, that is the retrieval, thus emerges from a hierarchy of connectionistic probabilities. The relation of this new theory of memory network formation to current and potential computational implementations will benefit by its unusual point of initiation: deep concerns about the molecular substrates of information storage.},

abstract = {Do neurons in primary motor cortex encode the generative details of motor behavior, such as individual muscle activities, or do they encode high-level movement attributes? Resolving this question has proven difficult, in large part because of the sizeable uncertainty inherent in estimating or measuring the joint torques and muscle forces that underlie movements made by biological limbs. We circumvented this difficulty by considering single-neuron responses in an isometric task, where joint torques and muscle forces can be straightforwardly computed from limb geometry. The response for each neuron was modeled as a linear function of a "preferred" joint torque vector, and this model was fit to individual neural responses across variations in limb posture. The resulting goodness of fit suggests that neurons in motor cortex do encode the kinetics of motor behavior and that the neural response properties of "preferred direction" and "gain" are dual components of a unitary response vector.},

abstract = {The phenotypic differences between individual organisms can often be ascribed to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical organisms in homogeneous environments vary, indicating that randomness in developmental processes such as gene expression may also generate diversity. To examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, whereas others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is subjected to a threshold, producing an ON/OFF expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation.},

@article{Aldworth2005,
abstract = {What is the meaning associated with a single action potential in a neural spike train? The answer depends on the way the question is formulated. One general approach toward formulating this question involves estimating the average stimulus waveform preceding spikes in a spike train. Many different algorithms have been used to obtain such estimates, ranging from spike-triggered averaging of stimuli to correlation-based extraction of "stimulus-reconstruction" kernels or spatiotemporal receptive fields. We demonstrate that all of these approaches miscalculate the stimulus feature selectivity of a neuron. Their errors arise from the manner in which the stimulus waveforms are aligned to one another during the calculations. Specifically, the waveform segments are locked to the precise time of spike occurrence, ignoring the intrinsic "jitter" in the stimulus-to-spike latency. We present an algorithm that takes this jitter into account. "Dejittered" estimates of the feature selectivity of a neuron are more accurate (i.e., provide a better estimate of the mean waveform eliciting a spike) and more precise (i.e., have smaller variance around that waveform) than estimates obtained using standard techniques. Moreover, this approach yields an explicit measure of spike-timing precision. We applied this technique to study feature selectivity and spike-timing precision in two types of sensory interneurons in the cricket cercal system. The dejittered estimates of the mean stimulus waveforms preceding spikes were up to three times larger than estimates based on the standard techniques used in previous studies and had power that extended into higher-frequency ranges. Spike timing precision was approximately 5 ms.},

abstract = {Mutants with abnormal patterns of locomotion, also known as uncoordinated (Unc) mutants, have facilitated the genetic dissection of many important aspects of nervous system function and development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Although a large number of distinct classes of Unc mutants can be distinguished by an experienced observer, precise quantitative definitions of these classes have not been available. Here we describe a new approach for using automatically-acquired image data to quantify the locomotion patterns of wild-type and mutant worms. We designed an automated tracking and imaging system capable of following an individual animal for long time periods and saving a time-coded series of digital images representing its motion and body posture over the course of the recording. We have also devised methods for measuring specific features from these image data that can be used by the classification and regression tree classification algorithm to reliably identify the behavioral patterns of specific mutant types. Ultimately, these tools should make it possible to evaluate with quantitative precision the behavioral phenotypes of novel mutants, gene knockout lines, or pharmacological treatments.},

abstract = {Many biological machines function in discrete steps, and detection of such steps can provide insight into the machines' dynamics. It is therefore crucial to develop an automated method to detect steps, and determine how its success is impaired by the significant noise usually present. A number of step detection methods have been used in previous studies, but their robustness and relative success rate have not been evaluated. Here, we compare the performance of four step detection methods on artificial benchmark data (simulating different data acquisition and stepping rates, as well as varying amounts of Gaussian noise). For each of the methods we investigate how to optimize performance both via parameter selection and via prefiltering of the data. While our analysis reveals that many of the tested methods have similar performance when optimized, we find that the method based on a chi-squared optimization procedure is simplest to optimize, and has excellent temporal resolution. Finally, we apply these step detection methods to the question of observed step sizes for cargoes moved by multiple kinesin motors in vitro. We conclude there is strong evidence for sub-8-nm steps of the cargo's center of mass in our multiple motor records.},

geometric deformable models --- the ability to automatically handle

where the object to be segmented has a known topology that must be

models designed using a novel topologypreserving level set method,
which achieves topology preservation by applying the simple point
concept from digital topology. These new models maintain the other
advantages of standard geometric deformable models including subpixel
accuracy and production of non-intersecting curves or surfaces. Moreover,
since the topology-preserving constraint is enforced efficiently
through local computations, the resulting algorithm incurs only nominal
computational overhead over standard geometric deformable models.},

abstract = {Extensive molecular, genetic, and anatomical analyses have suggested that olfactory memory is stored in the mushroom body (MB), a higher-order olfactory center in the insect brain. The MB comprises three subtypes of neurons with axons that extend into different lobes. A recent functional imaging study has revealed a long-term memory trace manifested as an increase in the Ca(2+) activity in an axonal branch of a subtype of MB neurons. However, early memory traces in the MB remain elusive. We report here learning-induced changes in Ca(2+) activities during early memory formation in a different subtype of MB neurons. We used three independent in vivo and in vitro preparations, and all of them showed that Ca(2+) activities in the axonal branches of alpha'/beta' neurons in response to a conditioned olfactory stimulus became larger compared with one that was not conditioned. The changes were dependent on proper G-protein signaling in the MB. The importance of these changes in the Ca(2+) activity of alpha'/beta' neurons during early memory formation was further tested behaviorally by disrupting G-protein signaling in these neurons or blocking their synaptic outputs during the learning and memory process. Our results suggest that increased Ca(2+) activity in response to a conditioned olfactory stimulus may be a neural correlate of early memory in the MB.},

abstract = {Many areas of biology and biotechnology have been revolutionized by

the ability to label proteins genetically by fusion to the Aequorea

green fluorescent protein (GFP). In previous fusions, the GFP has

been treated as an indivisible entity, usually appended to the amino

or carboxyl terminus of the host protein, occasionally inserted within

the host sequence. The tightly interwoven, three-dimensional structure

and intricate posttranslational self-modification required for chromophore

formation would suggest that major rearrangements or insertions within

GFP would prevent fluorescence. However, we now show that several

rearrangements of GFPs, in which the amino and carboxyl portions

are interchanged and rejoined with a short spacer connecting the

original termini, still become fluorescent. These circular permutations

have altered pKa values and orientations of the chromophore with

respect to a fusion partner. Furthermore, certain locations within

GFP tolerate insertion of entire proteins, and conformational changes

in the insert can have profound effects on the fluorescence. For

example, insertions of calmodulin or a zinc finger domain in place

of Tyr-145 of a yellow mutant (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein)

of GFP result in indicator proteins whose fluorescence can be enhanced

severalfold upon metal binding. The calmodulin graft into enhanced

yellow fluorescent protein can monitor cytosolic \{Ca\}\^{}\{2+\} in single

mammalian cells. The tolerance of GFPs for circular permutations

and insertions shows the folding process is surprisingly robust and

offers a new strategy for creating genetically encodable, physiological

abstract = {Neocortical action potential responses in vivo are characterized by considerable threshold variability, and thus timing and rate variability, even under seemingly identical conditions. This finding suggests that cortical ensembles are required for accurate sensorimotor integration and processing. Intracellularly, trial-to-trial variability results not only from variation in synaptic activities, but also in the transformation of these into patterns of action potentials. Through simultaneous axonal and somatic recordings and computational simulations, we demonstrate that the initiation of action potentials in the axon initial segment followed by backpropagation of these spikes throughout the neuron results in a distortion of the relationship between the timing of synaptic and action potential events. In addition, this backpropagation also results in an unusually high rate of rise of membrane potential at the foot of the action potential. The distortion of the relationship between the amplitude time course of synaptic inputs and action potential output caused by spike backpropagation results in the appearance of high spike threshold variability at the level of the soma. At the point of spike initiation, the axon initial segment, threshold variability is considerably less. Our results indicate that spike generation in cortical neurons is largely as expected by Hodgkin-Huxley theory and is more precise than previously thought.},

more

accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into

Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal,
model-based

decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts
20\% more

information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption
of

independence, and preserves 40\% more visual information than optimal
linear

In addition we quantified the dendritic geometry and electrical excitability of 3 types of the L2/3 INs: "local," "lateral," and "translaminar" inhibitors (Helmstaedter et al. 2008b). Here, we used an iterated cluster analysis (iCA) that combines axonal projection patterns with dendritic geometry and electrical excitability parameters to identify "groups" of INs, from a sample of 39 cells. The iCA defined 9 groups of INs. We propose a hierarchical scheme for identifying L2/3 INs. First, L2/3 INs can be classified as 4 types of axonal projections. Second, L2/3 INs can be subclassified as 9 groups with a high within-group similarity of dendritic, axonal, and electrical parameters. This scheme of identifying L2/3 INs may help to quantitatively describe inhibitory effects on sensory stimulus representations in L2/3 of cortical columns.},

function, but it is not clear how neural circuits support reliable

in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers
of a neuronal network, and the propagation of fluctuations in firing
rate across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise,
which was added to previous models from an external source, had to
be included to support stable propagation. Sparse, randomly connected
networks of spiking model neurons can generate chaotic patterns of
activity. We investigate whether this activity, which is a more realistic
noise source, is sufficient to allow for signal transmission. We
find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such
networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through
up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic
strengths. We investigate the factors affecting transmission and
show that multiple signals can propagate simultaneously along different
pathways. Using this feature, we show how different types of logic
gates can arise within the architecture of the random network through
the strengthening of specific synapses.},

abstract = {Pitch perception is critical for identifying and segregating auditory objects, especially in the context of music and speech. The perception of pitch is not unique to humans and has been experimentally demonstrated in several animal species. Pitch is the subjective attribute of a sound's fundamental frequency (f(0)) that is determined by both the temporal regularity and average repetition rate of its acoustic waveform. Spectrally dissimilar sounds can have the same pitch if they share a common f(0). Even when the acoustic energy at f(0) is removed ('missing fundamental') the same pitch is still perceived. Despite its importance for hearing, how pitch is represented in the cerebral cortex is unknown. Here we show the existence of neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys that respond to both pure tones and missing fundamental harmonic complex sounds with the same f(0), providing a neural correlate for pitch constancy. These pitch-selective neurons are located in a restricted low-frequency cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex, and is consistent with the location of a pitch-selective area identified in recent imaging studies in humans.},

Here, we differentiate them by analyzing the time course of their action potentials (APs) and characterizing their receptive field properties in auditory cortex. Pyramidal neurons have longer APs and discharge as regular-spiking units (RSUs), whereas basket and chandelier cells, which are inhibitory interneurons, have shorter APs and are fast-spiking units (FSUs). To compare these neuronal classes, we stimulated cat primary auditory cortex neurons with a dynamic moving ripple stimulus and constructed single-unit spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) and their associated nonlinearities. FSUs had shorter latencies, broader spectral tuning, greater stimulus specificity, and higher temporal precision than RSUs. The STRF structure of FSUs was more separable, suggesting more independence between spectral and temporal processing regimens. The nonlinearities associated with the two cell classes were indicative of higher feature selectivity for FSUs. These global functional differences between RSUs and FSUs suggest fundamental distinctions between putative excitatory and inhibitory interneurons that shape auditory cortical processing.},

@article{Bandyopadhyay2007,
abstract = {Neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) exhibit nonlinearities in spectral processing, which make it difficult to predict the neurons' responses to stimuli. Here, we consider two possible sources of nonlinearity: nonmonotonic responses as sound level increases due to inhibition and interactions between frequency components. A spectral weighting function model of rate responses is used; the model approximates the neuron's rate response as a weighted sum of the frequency components of the stimulus plus a second-order sum that captures interactions between frequencies. Such models approximate DCN neurons well at low spectral contrast, i.e., when the SD (contrast) of the stimulus spectrum is limited to 3 dB. This model is compared with a first-order sum with weights that are explicit functions of sound level, so that the low-contrast model is extended to spectral contrasts of 12 dB, the range of natural stimuli. The sound-level-dependent weights improve prediction performance at large spectral contrast. However, the interactions between frequencies, represented as second-order terms, are more important at low spectral contrast. The level-dependent model is shown to predict previously described patterns of responses to spectral edges, showing that small changes in the inhibitory components of the receptive field can produce large changes in the responses of the neuron to features of natural stimuli. These results provide an effective way of characterizing nonlinear auditory neurons incorporating stimulus-dependent sensitivity changes. Such models could be used for neurons in other sensory systems that show similar effects.},

abstract = {To gain insight into which parameters of neural activity are important in shaping the perception of odors, we combined a behavioral measure of odor perception with optical imaging of odor representations at the level of receptor neuron input to the rat olfactory bulb. Instead of the typical test of an animal's ability to discriminate two familiar odorants by exhibiting an operant response, we used a spontaneously expressed response to a novel odorant-exploratory sniffing-as a measure of odor perception. This assay allowed us to measure the speed with which rats perform spontaneous odor discriminations. With this paradigm, rats discriminated and began responding to a novel odorant in as little as 140 ms. This time is comparable to that measured in earlier studies using operant behavioral readouts after extensive training. In a subset of these trials, we simultaneously imaged receptor neuron input to the dorsal olfactory bulb with near-millisecond temporal resolution as the animal sampled and then responded to the novel odorant. The imaging data revealed that the bulk of the discrimination time can be attributed to the peripheral events underlying odorant detection: receptor input arrives at the olfactory bulb 100-150 ms after inhalation begins, leaving only 50-100 ms for central processing and response initiation. In most trials, odor discrimination had occurred even before the initial barrage of receptor neuron firing had ceased and before spatial maps of activity across glomeruli had fully developed. These results suggest a coding strategy in which the earliest-activated glomeruli play a major role in the initial perception of odor quality, and place constraints on coding and processing schemes based on simple changes in spike rate.},

abstract = {Reaching and grasping in primates depend on the coordination of neural activity in large frontoparietal ensembles. Here we demonstrate that primates can learn to reach and grasp virtual objects by controlling a robot arm through a closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMIc) that uses multiple mathematical models to extract several motor parameters (i.e., hand position, velocity, gripping force, and the EMGs of multiple arm muscles) from the electrical activity of frontoparietal neuronal ensembles. As single neurons typically contribute to the encoding of several motor parameters, we observed that high BMIc accuracy required recording from large neuronal ensembles. Continuous BMIc operation by monkeys led to significant improvements in both model predictions and behavioral performance. Using visual feedback, monkeys succeeded in producing robot reach-and-grasp movements even when their arms did not move. Learning to operate the BMIc was paralleled by functional reorganization in multiple cortical areas, suggesting that the dynamic properties of the BMIc were incorporated into motor and sensory cortical representations.},

abstract = {Theoretical and experimental studies of distributed neuronal representations of sensory and behavioral variables usually assume that the tuning of the mean firing rates is the main source of information. However, recent theoretical studies have investigated the effect of cross-correlations in the trial-to-trial fluctuations of the neuronal responses on the accuracy of the representation. Assuming that only the first-order statistics of the neuronal responses are tuned to the stimulus, these studies have shown that in the presence of correlations, similar to those observed experimentally in cortical ensembles of neurons, the amount of information in the population is limited, yielding nonzero error levels even in the limit of infinitely large populations of neurons. In this letter, we study correlated neuronal populations whose higher-order statistics, and in particular response variances, are also modulated by the stimulus. Weask two questions: Does the correlated noise limit the accuracy of the neuronal representation of the stimulus? and, How can a biological mechanism extract most of the information embedded in the higher-order statistics of the neuronal responses? Specifically, we address these questions in the context of a population of neurons coding an angular variable. We show that the information embedded in the variances grows linearly with the population size despite the presence of strong correlated noise. This information cannot be extracted by linear readout schemes, including the linear population vector. Instead, we propose a bilinear readout scheme that involves spatial decorrelation, quadratic nonlinearity, and population vector summation. We show that this nonlinear population vector scheme yields accurate estimates of stimulus parameters, with an efficiency that grows linearly with the population size. This code can be implemented using biologically plausible neurons.},

abstract = {To obtain a more complete description of individual neurons, it is necessary to complement the electrical patch pipette measurements with technologies that permit a massive parallel recording from many sites on neuronal processes. This can be achieved by using voltage imaging with intracellular dyes. With this approach, we investigated the functional structure of a mitral cell, the principal output neuron in the rat olfactory bulb. The most significant finding concerns the characteristics of EPSPs at the synaptic sites and surprisingly small attenuation along the trunk of the primary dendrite. Also, the experiments were performed to determine the number, location, and stability of spike trigger zones, the excitability of terminal dendritic branches, and the pattern and nature of spike initiation and propagation in the primary and secondary dendrites. The results show that optical data can be used to deduce the amplitude and shape of the EPSPs evoked by olfactory nerve stimulation at the site of origin (glomerular tuft) and to determine its attenuation along the entire length of the primary dendrite. This attenuation corresponds to an unusually large mean apparent "length constant" of the primary dendrite. Furthermore, the images of spike trigger zones showed that an action potential can be initiated in three different compartments of the mitral cell: the soma-axon region, the primary dendrite trunk, and the terminal dendritic tuft, which appears to be fully excitable. Finally, secondary dendrites clearly support the active propagation of action potentials.},

But effective computation of the shape skeleton remains a notorious unsolved problem; existing approaches are extremely sensitive to noise and give counterintuitive results with simple shapes. In conventional approaches, the skeleton is defined by a geometric construction and computed by a deterministic procedure. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic approach, in which a shape is assumed to have "grown" from a skeleton by a stochastic generative process. Bayesian estimation is used to identify the skeleton most likely to have produced the shape, i.e., that best "explains" it, called the maximum a posteriori skeleton. Even with natural shapes with substantial contour noise, this approach provides a robust skeletal representation whose branches correspond to the natural parts of the shape.},

abstract = {A key technical barrier to furthering our understanding of complex neural networks has been the lack of tools for the simultaneous spatiotemporal control and detection of activity in a large number of neurons. Here, we report an all-optical system for achieving this kind of parallel and selective control and detection. We do this by delivering spatiotemporally complex optical stimuli through a digital micromirror spatiotemporal light modulator to cells expressing the light-activated ionotropic glutamate receptor (LiGluR), which have been labeled with a calcium dye to provide a fluorescent report of activity. Reliable and accurate spatiotemporal stimulation was obtained on HEK293 cells and cultured rat hippocampal neurons. This technique should be adaptable to in vivo applications and could serve as an optical interface for communicating with complex neural circuits.},

abstract = {The cerebellum evolved in association with the electric sense and vestibular sense of the earliest vertebrates. Accurate information provided by these sensory systems would have been essential for precise control of orienting behavior in predation. A simple model shows that individual spikes in electrosensory primary afferent neurons can be interpreted as measurements of prey location. Using this result, I construct a computational neural model in which the spatial distribution of spikes in a secondary electrosensory map forms a Monte Carlo approximation to the Bayesian posterior distribution of prey locations given the sense data. The neural circuit that emerges naturally to perform this task resembles the cerebellar-like hindbrain electrosensory filtering circuitry of sharks and other electrosensory vertebrates. The optimal filtering mechanism can be extended to handle dynamical targets observed from a dynamical platform; that is, to construct an optimal dynamical state estimator using spiking neurons. This may provide a generic model of cerebellar computation. Vertebrate motion-sensing neurons have specific fractional-order dynamical characteristics that allow Bayesian state estimators to be implemented elegantly and efficiently, using simple operations with asynchronous pulses, i.e. spikes. The computational neural models described in this paper represent a novel kind of particle filter, using spikes as particles. The models are specific and make testable predictions about computational mechanisms in cerebellar circuitry, while providing a plausible explanation of cerebellar contributions to aspects of motor control, perception and cognition.},

abstract = {A one-electron model for the photodissociation and recombination dynamics
of a diatomic anion has been proposed. The main purpose of the study
is to provide a simple model to better understand the effect of strong
coupling between the solvent polarization and the extra charge in
a system like I2 2. The model diatomic anion consists of two identical
nuclei and an extra electron whose dynamics are treated explicitly.
The effect of solvent polarization is modeled by introducing an effective
solvent field representing a nonequilibrium solvent configuration.
Nonadiabatic theoretical calculations, in which the electronic and
the nuclear dynamics are treated simultaneously, can reveal the importance
of nonadiabatic effects by including intrinsically all the electronic
states involved. It is found that a purely dissociative excited state
can support recombination due to coupling of the anomalous charge
distribution with the solvent polarization. The charge switching
and the subsequent charge separation for the dissociating fragments
are strongly coupled with the fluctuating solvent polarization, as
represented by the time-dependent solvent field in the present model.
The results of the calculations with varying time scales for the
solvent response have demonstrated the possibility of numerous diverse
phenomena resulting from nonadiabatic transitions. In particular,
we found charge transfer induced by changing solvent polarization.
The general model presented in the study provides a reasonable interpretation,
at least on a qualitative level, for the interesting features obtained
from recent experiments and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics studies
on the photodissociation of I2 2 in molecular clusters.},

In biology the most severe aberration is introduced when an oil-immersion objective lens is used to study thick specimens, such as living cells and tissues, whose refractive indices are significantly different from that of the immersion oil. We present a model of the three-dimensional imaging properties of a fluorescence light microscope subject to such aberration and compare the imaging properties predicted by the model with those measured experimentally. The model can be used to understand and compensate for aberration introduced to a microscope system under nondesign optical conditions so that both confocal laser scanning microscopy and optical serial sectioning microscopy can be optimized.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.3±0.07 ns FWHM to 6.92±0.02 ns FWHM (11.52±0.05 ns to 4.89±0.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {Moving one part of the body can generate interaction forces that tend to destabilize other parts of the body. However, stability is maintained by mechanisms that predict and actively oppose these interaction forces. When our body or environment changes, these anticipatory mechanisms adapt so as to continue to produce accurate predictions. In this study, we examine the acquisition of a novel predictive coordination between the arms, in a situation in which a force is produced on one hand as a consequence of the action of the other hand. Specifically, a force was applied to the left hand that depended on the velocity of the right hand. With practice, subjects learned to stabilize the perturbed left arm during right-arm movements by predicting and actively opposing the externally applied forces. After adaptation, we examined how learning generalized to a new joint configuration of the right or left arm to investigate the coordinate systems in which the internal transformation from movement to force is represented. This revealed a dissociation between the representation of the action of the right arm and the representation of its consequence, that is the force on the left arm. The movement is represented in extrinsic coordinates related to the velocity of the hand, whereas the force resulting from the movement is represented in a joint-based intrinsic coordinate system.},

Here we make some steps toward relating anatomical structure to computational function. We use methods of quantitative neuroanatomy to estimate the cortical circuit by defining the projection matrix between the various cells types of the neocortex of the cat, and then we consider the implications of this connectivity for cortical signal processing. Our analyses show that for a reasonable choice of the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory efficacy, the overall cortical circuit lies near the border of dynamical stability. We discuss a model of co-operative competitive processing that is consistent with the observed connectivity in the superficial layers of the cortex, and consider also how the topology of the overall cortical circuit could be configured dynamically through average inhibition.},

abstract = {How does the brain orchestrate perceptions, thoughts and actions from the spiking activity of its neurons? Early single-neuron recording research treated spike pattern variability as noise that needed to be averaged out to reveal the brain's representation of invariant input. Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron-electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

of neural tissue from serial section transmission electron micrographs.
Such reconstructions require 3D segmentation of individual neuronal

We first detect neuronal cell profiles in each image in a stack of
serial micrographs with multi-scale ridge detector. Short breaks
in detected boundaries are interpolated using anisotropic contour
completion formulated in fuzzy-logic framework. Detected profiles
from adjacent sections are linked together based on cues such as
shape similarity and image texture. Thus obtained 3D segmentation
is validated by human operators in computer-guided proofreading process.
Our approach makes possible reconstructions of neural tissue at final
rate of about 5 microm3/manh, as determined primarily by the speed
of proofreading. To date we have applied this approach to reconstruct
few blocks of neural tissue from different regions of rat brain totaling
over 1000microm3, and used these to evaluate reconstruction speed,

Synapto-pHluorin selectively labeled presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons in glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Odorant stimulation evoked large-amplitude fluorescence increases that were localized to individual glomeruli in vivo, correlated with presynaptic calcium influx, graded with stimulus intensity, and stable over a period of days. Spatial patterns of odorant-activated glomeruli were distributed and did not change systematically with increasing carbon chain length, in contrast to the finely organized chemotopy that has been reported using other imaging methods. Targeted expression of synapto-pHluorin in mouse will permit the analysis of previously inaccessible neuronal populations and chronic imaging from genetically identified neurons in vivo.},

It has been proposed that olfactory bulb mitral cells exhibit this functional circuitry, with excitation from one glomerulus and inhibition from a broad field of glomeruli within reach of the lateral dendrites. We investigated this hypothesis using a combination of in vivo intrinsic imaging, single-unit recording, and a large panel of odors. Assuming a broad inhibitory field, a mitral cell would be influenced by >100 contiguous glomeruli and should respond to many odors. Instead, the observed response rate was an order of magnitude lower. A quantitative model indicates that mitral cell responses can be explained by just a handful of glomeruli. These glomeruli are spatially dispersed on the bulb and represent a broad range of odor sensitivities. We conclude that mitral cells do not have center-surround receptive fields. Instead, each mitral cell performs a specific computation combining a small and diverse set of glomerular inputs.},

abstract = {Processing of rapidly successive acoustic stimuli can be markedly improved by sensory training. To investigate the cortical mechanisms underlying such temporal plasticity, we trained rats in a 'sound maze' in which navigation using only auditory cues led to a target location paired with food reward. In this task, the repetition rate of noise pulses increased as the distance between the rat and target location decreased. After training in the sound maze, neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) showed greater responses to high-rate noise pulses and stronger phase-locking of responses to the stimuli; they also showed shorter post-stimulation suppression and stronger rebound activation. These improved temporal dynamics transferred to trains of pure-tone pips. Control animals that received identical sound stimulation but were given free access to food showed the same results as naive rats. We conclude that this auditory perceptual learning results in improvements in temporal processing, which may be mediated by enhanced cortical response dynamics.},

abstract = {Ocular following (OFR) is a short-latency visual stabilization response to the optic flow experienced during self-motion. It has been proposed that it represents the early component of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) and that it is functionally linked to the vestibularly driven stabilization reflex during translation (translational vestibuloocular reflex, TVOR). Because no single eye movement can eliminate slip from the whole retina during translation, the OFR and the TVOR appear to be functionally related to maintaining visual acuity on the fovea. Other foveal-specific eye movements, like smooth pursuit and saccades, exhibit an eye-position-dependent torsional component, as dictated by what is known as the "half-angle rule" of Listing's law. In contrast, eye movements that stabilize images on the whole retina, such as the rotational vestibuloocular reflex (RVOR) and steady-state OKN do not. Consistent with the foveal stabilization hypothesis, it was recently shown that the TVOR is indeed characterized by an eye-position-dependent torsion, similar to pursuit eye movements. Here we have investigated whether the OFR exhibits three-dimensional kinematic properties consistent with a foveal response (i.e., similar to the TVOR and smooth pursuit eye movements) or with a whole-field stabilization function (similar to steady-state OKN). The OFR was elicited using 100-ms ramp motion of a full-field random dot pattern that moved horizontally at 20, 62, or 83 degrees/s. To study if an eye-position-dependent torsion is generated during the OFR, we varied the initial fixation position vertically within a range of +/-20 degrees . As a control, horizontal smooth pursuit eye movements were also elicited using step-ramp target motion (10, 20, or 30 degrees/s) at similar eccentric positions. We found that the OFR followed kinematic properties similar to those seen in pursuit and the TVOR with the eye-position-dependent torsional tilt of eye velocity having slopes that averaged 0.73 +/- 0.16 for OFR and 0.57 +/- 0.12 (means +/- SD) for pursuit. These findings support the notion that the OFR, like the TVOR and pursuit, are foveal image stabilization systems.},

abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an important model for examining synaptic
mechanisms of learning and memory. A key question is whether the
enhanced synaptic transmission occurring with LTP involves the addition
of new synapses, the enlargement of existing synapses, or a redistribution
in synaptic weight among synapses. Two experimental designs were
used to address this question. In the first experimental design three
conditions were evaluated across hippocampal slices maintained in
vitro, including slices with LTP analyzed at 2 hr post-tetanus, slices
tetanized in the presence of APV, and control slices receiving test
stimulation only. In the second experimental design independent LTP
and control (low-frequency stimulation) sites were examined. Synapse
density was estimated by an unbiased volume sampling procedure. Synapse
size was computed by three-dimensional reconstruction from serial
electron microscopy (EM). Serial EM also was used to compute synapse
number per unit length of dendrite. In both experimental designs
there were no significant effects of LTP on total synapse number,
on the distribution of different types of synapses (thin, mushroom,
stubby, or branched dendritic spines and macular, perforated, or
segmented postsynaptic densities), on the frequency of shaft synapses,
nor on the relative proportion of single or multiple synapse axonal
boutons. There was also no increase in synapse size. These results
suggest that LTP does not cause an overall formation of new synapses
nor an enlargement of synapses at 2 hr post-tetanus in hippocampal
area CA1, and these results support the hypothesis that LTP could
involve a redistribution of synaptic weights among existing synapses.},

Here we report results of an empirical study of the predictive power of the h index compared with other indicators. Our findings indicate that the h index is better than other indicators considered (total citation count, citations per paper, and total paper count) in predicting future scientific achievement. We discuss reasons for the superiority of the h index.},

abstract = {The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method is recommended
for farm surveillance programs and may be useful for epidemiological
studies in wildlife or for establishing Trichinella-free areas. In
this study, our interest was to compare the specificity and the time
of seroconversion of excretory-secretory (E/S) antigens prepared
from Trichinella spiralis. A group of eight pigs was inoculated with
500 T. spiralis larvae per animal, and blood sampling was performed
at 3 and 4-day intervals during all experiments. The numbers of muscle
larvae were determined in four different muscles groups. The larvae
per gram burden shows that the most heavily parasitized muscles were
the diaphragm [mean = 43.7 larvae per gram (lpg)] and the tongue
(mean = 16.9 lpg). Antibody responses were detected by any of eight
infected pigs of T. spiralis. Using the ELISA method with E/S antigen,
antibodies to T. spiralis were first found on the day 21st p.i. The
initial detection of antibodies varied from 21st to 31st day p.i.,
and the peak was reported 42nd day p.i. Dynamic of antibodies was
stable or increased slightly throughout the experimental period (60
days post-inoculation). Our results represent important data for
validation of a serological test, especially if blood samples are
taken during early stages of infection.},

@article{GreenbergKerr09,
abstract = {Two-photon imaging of bulk-loaded calcium dyes can record action potentials
(APs) simultaneously from dozens of spatially resolved neurons in
vivo. Extending this technique to awake animals, however, has remained
technically challenging due to artifacts caused by brain motion.
Since in two-photon excitation microscopes image pixels are captured
sequentially by scanning a focused pulsed laser across small areas
of interest within the brain, fast displacements of the imaged area
can distort the image nonuniformly. If left uncorrected, brain motion
in awake animals will cause artifactual fluorescence changes, masking
the small functional fluorescence increases associated with AP discharge.
We therefore present a procedure for detection and correction of
both fast and slow displacements in two-photon imaging of awake animals.
Our algorithm, based on the Lucas–Kanade framework, operates directly
on the motion-distorted imaging data, requiring neither external
signals such as heartbeat nor a distortion-free template image. Motion
correction accuracy was tested in silico over a wide range of simplified
and realistic displacement trajectories and for multiple levels of
fluorescence noise. Accuracy was confirmed in vivo by comparing solutions
obtained from red and green fluorophores imaged simultaneously. Finally,
the accuracy of AP detection from motion-displaced bulk-loaded calcium
imaging is evaluated with and without motion correction, and we conclude
that accurate motion correction as achieved by this procedure is
both necessary and sufficient for single AP detection in awake animals.},

abstract = {Object perception seems effortless to us, but it depends on intensive neural processing across multiple stages in ventral pathway visual cortex. Shape information at the retinal level is hopelessly complex, variable and implicit. The ventral pathway must somehow transform retinal signals into much more compact, stable and explicit representations of object shape. Recent findings highlight key aspects of this transformation: higher-order contour derivatives, structural representation in object-based coordinates, composite shape tuning dimensions, and long-term storage of object knowledge. These coding principles could help to explain our remarkable ability to perceive, distinguish, remember and understand a virtual infinity of objects.},
